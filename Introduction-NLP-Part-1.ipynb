How you doing? Thank you for that. Thank you for that. You all getting fucked up?', '[cheering]', 'I’m not drinking. I got water. -I can’t drink like I used to drink. Okay?', '[audience] Aww.', 'I used to drink– I used to be a daily drinker. I used to be five drinks, every day, seven days a week, which is 35 drinks a week. Which the FDA of America says that means I’m an alcoholic. They say anything over 20 drinks makes you an alcoholic. Bullshit. [laughter] That’s less than three drinks a fucking day. That’s a reasonable amount of fucking drinking. You can have three drinks a day. There’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t have a problem.', '[laughter]', 'Two lines of coke a day isn’t a coke problem.', '[laughter]', 'It isn’t a coke problem. That’s less than a gram a week. [laughter] You know why I stopped drinking so much is because I cracked open a beer, and my son, he was five at the time, he looked up at me, he went, “Daddy, are you drinking again?” [laughter] I’m like, “Where the fuck did that come from, you little…?” [laughter] Like, very clearly it was from the woman who I gave a house to, but I was like… [laughter]', 'So, I don’t… I don’t drink… I don’t drink like that anymore. I don’t drink, ’cause I’m a good dad, you know? So, what I do now is I just drink one day a week, but I still get my 35 in. [laughter] That’s how society has pushed me.', '[cheering and applause]', 'That’s why if you ever see, like, a woman and she’s like in her mid-thirties and it’s 9:00 p.m. and she’s all dolled up, but it’s like she’s holding her shoes and just stumbling around and vomiting in alleyways, don’t feel sorry for her. She’s just a good mom. [laughter] Found a window of fucking time. [laughter]', 'The Queen of England drinks four cocktails a day. That’s eight standard drinks a day. That means she’s a full-blown fucking alkie. Full-blown. [laughter] My question is, is she a nice drunk or a fucking nasty drunk? Around cocktail three, does she start trawling the palace, just… [laughter] “Philip! [laughter] Philip!” And Philip’s like, “Ah, fuck, Lizzie’s at it again. [laughter] Get my Land Rover ready.” [laughter] She’s just trawling around, “Philip!” [laughter] She goes into one room, she jumps back out with a crown on her head, “Ha-ha! [laughter] I look like the money.” [laughter]', 'I got to tell you a story right now. To tell this story, I have to start off by saying that I’m lactose intolerant.', '[woman cheers]', 'That means that I will not… tolerate lactose. [laughter] If I eat lactose, 40 minutes later, and you can set your fucking watch by it, [laughter] I will shit myself. [laughter] That sounds like more than just intolerance, doesn’t it? [laughter] I shit myself. [laughter] Like, think about it right now. So, you’re all in groups, right? You’ve probably got groups of three, four friends you’re all hanging out with. And then you have your periphery groups. Like, some cunt in your group has brought some friends from work. Right? And there’s always one cunt in that fucking group where you, like, you turn to one of your good friends and you go, “Can’t tolerate that guy. Can’t tolerate him.” But it’s not like, if he comes near you, [laughter] you shit yourself. [laughter]', 'So, my two biggest nemesisises… Nemesi? -[laughter] -N– The two things that– that I’m not good with… [laughter] are ice cream and cheese. Now, here’s the tragedy that is my life. Ice cream and cheese are also my two favorite things. [laughter] See, I wasn’t always lactose intolerant. No, it happened to me at 35. I’m 42 now. It happened on my 35th birthday. I was sitting down, having my Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake, as I always request. I’m hoeing into it, and then God looked at me and went, “How’s all those atheist jokes going, cunt? -Pew!”', '[laughter] [cheering and applause]', 'So now I can’t eat ice cream and cheese. Right? But here’s the thing. I still eat ice cream and cheese. [laughter] With the full knowledge that I’m going to shit myself, I still fucking do it. Right? I– I, actually, what I do is if I have a heavy meal, I eat a scoop of ice cream afterwards ’cause then I know I’ll shit everything out, cause… [laughter] I’m a genius, you see? That’s the Jefferies diet. You can fucking take that home with you. [laughter]', 'So, I still eat ice cream and cheese, but I don’t eat them out in the wild. [laughter] You’ll never see me on a boardwalk with an ice cream cone. No, no, no. I eat them at home, amongst people who love me and respect me. Where I know where the toilet is, I know how much toilet paper we’ve got, I’m ready to fucking go. [laughter] So, although I am intolerant of lactose, I still, you could argue, tolerate it. [laughter] In the same way that my dad… doesn’t hate gay people… [laughter] he’s just intolerant of them. [laughter]', 'My father’s a 78-year-old man from rural Australia, and when we were growing up, I heard him say the occasional homophobic slur. When he was young, uh, being gay was a mental illness. He’s a product of his environment. But two years ago, Australia had a referendum, where they voted on gay marriage, and my father voted “yes.” And that’s because I spent time talking to him, going, “Dad, it’s the right thing.” And then my dad said, “Well, I guess they deserve to be as miserable as the rest of us.” [laughter] Now, because my father has done this one forward-thinking thing in his entire life, my dad now thinks he is woke as fuck. [laughter] And my dad says sentences like this. “I’ve got no problems with the gays, they can do whatever they want, in their own homes, behind closed doors, as long as they don’t try to involve me.” [laughter] And I’m always like, “Dad, are they trying to involve you?” [laughter] Is there a scenario… [laughter] …where there’s two gay fellas in the inner suburbs of Sydney, one’s strapped up to a bed with a fucking gag ball in his mouth, the other one’s lubing up his fist, and he’s about to enter, and just as he’s about to go in, this fella goes… [muffled screaming] And he goes, “What’s that, mate?” “Maybe we should try to involve Gary Jefferies.” [laughter] “Oh, that’s a brilliant idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” He unstraps him. They get in their Honda Civic, and they fucking drive. [laughter] It’s a Friday night in Sydney, it’s raining, you’ve got to get around the harbor, it’s fucking– traffic’s horrendous. It takes them an hour 15. They get out to the house where my dad lives. My dad’s just sitting there, watching rugby league. [laughter] He hears a knock on the door. [laughter] [laughter continues] “That’s the second time this month. [laughter] I told you not to involve me.” [laughter]', 'Now, I was, uh, touring in Sydney earlier this year, and I did that routine. My father was in the audience, and he’d brought along all of his bowling friends. My father plays lawn bowls, uh, every day, uh, which is like, uh, curling but with a ball and… You’ll figure it out. Anyway… So he brought these, like, eight mates, and all of his mates were aged between 70 and 90. Right? All these blokes fucking went along. And then my dad came backstage, they’re all sinking piss backstage. My dad comes up to me and goes, “Yeah, I enjoyed the show. Yeah, it was a good show. Good show. Different jokes you’re doing now. Uh… I didn’t like that bit about me and the two gay fellas. I didn’t.” [laughter] And I didn’t understand why, and it turned out the reason he was upset, not because I spoke about him maybe having sex with two men, but because his friends found out that he voted “yes” for gay marriage. [laughter] And now… And now all of his mates take the piss out of him, right? Every time they go to do their shoelaces, they’re like, “Will you marry me, Gary?” [laughter]', 'That’s the thing about my dad, man, he’s trying. At his age, he’s still trying to be progressive and all that type of stuff. And here’s the problem, with young people, right. So… so, he’s backstage, he’s having a few beers, he’s voted yes for gay marriage. Everyone’s teasing him a bit. And then my dad, at 78, says, “Oh, yeah, I’m good with the gays, I like the gays.” And then he goes, “I don’t know about those trans people.” And then a person I know started going, “Well, you’re transphobic. You’re transphobic.” And I was like, “All right, everyone settle the fuck down. [laughter] Settle down.” And I said, “This guy just got used to gay people yesterday. [laughter] Let him have his fucking victory lap. You’re going to scare him off, you cunt.” [laughter] Like, let him be old, you cunt. He goes like this, “Gay people are okay.” And then you go, “Chicks with dicks,” and he’s like, “Fuck off.” [laughter]', 'This is the thing about being progressive and being woke and all that fucking bullshit, right? The-the-the young generations, the millennials, what you’re missing out on is… Let old people be fucking old, right? They’ll be dead soon enough, right? Stop fucking making everyone move as fast as you’re fucking moving, all right? People are trying. Right? Here’s the thing about millennials. You’re the worst people that have ever lived. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'You’re the worst. You’re just a horrible breed of people. And I don’t even blame you, it’s just the society you’re in. You have social media. Every single peanut fucking thought that ever came into your head, “I’ll fucking comment…” [laughter]', 'What type of fucking low-rent cunts are you? [laughter] Like… if you take more than three selfies a week, fucking end it. End it. [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right? [cheering and applause continues] The idea that you think taking a photo of yourself, isn’t there something mentally wrong with that? And it’s not just… That’s– That’s bad. That’s bad as it is. But the fact that when you take that photo, your next thought is, “Other people might want to see this.” [laughter] You’re the fucking worst. I… I’ve tried dating you people. It’s a fucking nightmare, right? I don’t care how smooth your fucking skin is, I’ll take an old person with a better fucking attitude, you pricks. [laughter] [cheering and applause] You know, you date a millennial… I used to have nice outings. You used to go to a beach, and you’d watch the sunset. No, fuck that. Sunsets are ruined because you cunts all want to do yoga poses while I stand back here, going, “Did I do a good photo?” [laughter] Heaven forbid I walk past a wall where someone’s painted some fucking wings on, that’s my whole day fucking ruined. [laughter] See, here’s the thing about you. You are… the most progressive generation that’s ever been. That is true. You are the most progressive generation that’s ever been. But here’s something for you. Every generation before you has also been the most progressive generation that’s ever been. You’re not fucking special.', '[laughter]', '[woman] Yeah!', 'One day, and you don’t even see it coming, in about 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be the old bigots. [laughter] You don’t see it coming, do you? You’ll be the old bigots. You’ll be standing around with your friends, going, “I don’t understand the kids today. When I was young, women had penises and men had vaginas, and it was all very normal. [laughter] But my grandson says he identifies as an Asian woman who wants to be a black man and marry a fucking robot, and I’m not having it.” [laughter] So my point is… I can’t eat cheese. [laughter] So… [cheering and applause] I can’t. I can’t. It’s not good for me. So… So, I-I went on a date with this girl. I went maybe six or seven dates with her. And I took her out to one of those tasting menu restaurants. You know, those fancy restaurants, Michelin-star thing, where there’s, like, 11 or 12 courses. This is a good move. For any young fella out there who wants to take a girl out, take them to a tasting menu, because if you’re like me, I eat my food too quick, and then I’ve got to sit there and watch them try to, you know… Then I think, “How much of that am I gonna get to eat?” You know? And if you go to a tasting menu, the brilliant thing about going to a fancy restaurant is that the conversation never stops. Because there’s so many courses that you can go, “I liked that course. I didn’t like course number three, but I enjoyed seven, so I wonder what’s up next.” It’s a good way of keeping things going.', '[laughter] -Now… I tried to do… I tried to do this routine in Kansas. Very hard to explain… [laughter] …what a really good meal’s like. They fucking… They couldn’t wrap their brain around it. I was like, “You know when you go to one of those really fancy restaurants?” [laughter] And I went, “Think about the best meal you’ve ever had.” And then one guy yells out, “Ribs!” And I was like, “Yeah… Yeah, ribs are good. [laughter] But think of a meal that’s even better than ribs.” And he thought about it and he went, “Two ribs!” And I went, “Yeah.” [laughter] So these restaurants… they’re pretentious as fuck, right? Every– Every dish includes a foam, a reduction, and a mousse. And there’s always a quail’s egg and a truffle. Always with a quail’s egg. Why can’t they use a fucking chicken egg? [laughter] Every time I go to the supermarket, I always go to the poultry. I’m never like, “Oh, quail or chicken, what will we eat tonight?” Where the fuck are they buying all the quails’ eggs? [laughter] And come to think of it, I’m not sure… if I’ve ever seen a quail. [laughter] I’ve never been out and gone, “Ah, fuck me, the quails are out tonight. [laughter] Better get the car in the garage, don’t want it covered in quail shit. fucking quails.” So it’s always a reduction, a mousse, and a foam, next to a quail’s egg with a truffle on top. And the first course is always called the amuse-bouche. The amuse-bouche is never on the menu. And what this is in fancy food is you eat that, and that’s meant to make you realize what the rest of the meal might be like. It’s to make you go, “Oh, we’re eating. Oh. [laughter] I get what’s going on. This is a small portion of bigger things.” It’s like if before you came to the show, you all went to a smaller comedy club tonight and watched someone do a five-minute set. So you could go, “I get what Jim’s gonna do.” [laughter] And there’s always some French cunt who’s the waiter. [laughter] I can say this on Netflix, the French are a bunch of cunts. I’m not sure if… [laughter] Are you even watching it? -On your French Netflix?', '[cheering] [applause] Anyway, so there’s always a French fuck. [laughter] He walks out, and the first course is always served on, like, a ceramic white spoon, with the reduction, the mousse, and the foam, and the quail’s egg, and something on top. And he walks up to you, and he’s very patronizing, and he goes, “Okay, now it’s time for the amuse-bouche.” And then he goes, “The chef has prepared this for you.” And you always… you always nod along, like, “Oh, that’s good, the chef,” when you really should just be an asshole to him and just go, “The chef, you say? [laughter] Did you hear that, honey? The chef’s doing the cooking today. [laughter] I thought the busboy had just fucking stepped it up a gear, but fuck me, I think we’re in for a treat.” [laughter] And then he has the audacity to tell you how to eat it. He goes, “Uh, the chef recommends that you put the spoon in your mouth and you eat it all in one bite, and let the quail’s egg explode over the foam, the mousse, and the reduction, and then you swallow.” “All right.” When you should really go, “Thank fuck you came along, cunt.', '[laughter]', 'I wouldn’t have known what to do. [laughter] A spoon, you say? A spoon? I would’ve…” [laughter] [chuckles]', 'So then you go through that, then you get a couple more courses. Then there’s always a course that involves something… The ingredients they use aren’t the ingredients that you want to fucking eat, right? If you were to buy a pork product in a supermarket and you were spending money, it would be, like, a pork loin or a chop, right? In these restaurants, it’s always like, “This is the kidney of the thing and the fingernail of the hoof. And… and you are getting the rind from the pig’s eye, the eye socket of the pig.” And you’re like, “Oh, I haven’t got enough socket in my fucking diet.” At the end you’re like, “I’m eating bone marrow, I didn’t know what a bone marrow fan I fucking am.”', 'And it’s all shit. It’s all fucking bad for you. [laughter] I always… I always feel fatter after… This is the deal, right? I’m recording a special right now, so I’ve dropped, like, seven pounds in a week, by just not fucking eating, just not fucking eating, and… I come from a long line of fat people. Right? I come from fat people. The reason I… I lose weight is because of you, the general public, and your comments on the internet. [laughter] Without you and your words of wisdom, I’d be a fat fuck, but thank God you all come along, and you fucking bully the fuck out of me.', '[laughter]', 'See, I’m not… I’m not for fat shaming, but I kind of am, I kind of am. [laughter] I’m not for any shaming, really, but I don’t know why we’ve gotten to this moment in society where fat people are immune to being shamed, yet every other addiction in our society is shamed. I watched my mother eat herself to death. I fucking watched it. She hid food, she fucking kept on eating, she denied what she was doing, and she fucking died from it, right? I watched it happen. But for some reason, we have to look at fat people and go, “You be your best self, you’re looking great.” Every other fucking addiction in our society, we shame. You smoke a cigarette… You don’t think smokers feel shame? You don’t think smokers are breathing fucking smoke into their lungs, going, “I’m a piece of shit. I’m a parent, what the fuck am I doing with my life?” We don’t need you to go, “You smell. [laughter] You’re killing yourself, go outside. [laughter] There’s a section for people like you.” [laughter]', 'Like fucking cocaine addicts. You don’t think they feel shame? Every time a cocaine addict has a line, they literally have to look at themselves in the fucking mirror. [laughter] You don’t compliment a fucking meth addict who’s picking scabs off their face, like, “You be you. [laughter] You’re living your best life.” No, but eating, we have to watch people get fat as fuck and compliment them? Fuck off. Should be the same as smoking. A fat cunt comes into a doughnut store, the person behind the counter should be able to go, “You’re gonna have to eat that outside.” [laughter] They’ll go outside with their doughnut… Aww. And they’ll have a little roped-off section. Let’s make it small, give them a fucking incentive. [laughter] They can stand out there with the other fatties and look at each other and go, “Oh.”', '[laughter]', '“Do you remember when we were allowed to eat on planes?” [laughter]', 'So, anyway, then we go on through the menu, course number five. Now, these fancy restaurants always have a foie gras course. Foie gras, it’s fucking delicious. I didn’t know what it was for years. I just enjoyed it. It’s this buttery, fucking fleshy thing. It’s delicious. And then someone showed me a video. Do you know how they make foie gras? They get a goose, then they step on its fucking feet, and then they pull the goose’s neck up, like this, and they get what’s called a foie gras funnel, which is like a funnel with a big, long tube, and they shove it down the goose’s throat until the goose looks like a fucking sword swallower. [laughter] And then they force-feed the goose grains, day and night, right? And then after that, they wire the goose’s mouth shut so it can’t vomit the food back up. Because of doing this, the goose gets cirrhosis of the liver, and the liver gets fat and yellow, and that’s what gives it that buttery taste. [laughter]', 'My big question is… [laughter] …who was the first cunt to figure that out? [laughter] Who… Who was the first bloke just to walk up to his mates and just go, “Hey, guys… [laughter] I was torturing geese… [laughter] …as I always do… [laughter] …and you would not believe the delicious side effects.” [laughter]', 'Now, I don’t believe in animal cruelty, uh, but– but who here, uh, thinks that we should no longer test on animals?', '[cheering and applause]', 'All right! They’re what we call fucking idiots. [laughter] If you’re a fucking moron who just applauded, “There should be no animal testing,” you fucking basic cunt. [laughter] Now, I don’t think we should test on animals for something as frivolous as makeup. But when it comes to medicine, what’s our fucking other option? Let’s just think of something really simple, like acne cream. Right? You can’t just get a cucumber… [laughter] …smear the cream on the cucumber and go, “No change to cucumber. [laughter] Ready for people.” [laughter] No, you’ve got to start with a mouse, don’t you? Smear it on the mouse, that mouse dissolves. [laughter] “First cream not good.” [laughter] Then you get another cream. That mouse fucking multiplies like a mogwai hit with water. [laughter] “Better… [laughter] …than first cream. [laughter] Still… not good.” [laughter] Then you get one where it works. Then you go, “That one’s good.” Then you get a rat. Then you get a rabbit. Then you get a cat, then you get a dog, then you get a primate, then you get a homeless person, a student, then us. [laughter] And that’s how we have the medicine. [laughter]', 'So moving on, we go to fucking course number six. The waiter brings up a cart. This thing has a dome on the top. And he rocks up with this fucking thing with the dome. He carried all the other food, but this thing needs a trolley. [laughter] And he pulls it off and there’s all these cheeses there. And he goes, “Your next course is the fromage,” like that. The fro… Actually, I don’t like that. I don’t like that the cunt called it fromage. [laughter] I know it’s a little thing, but it bothers me. He was just doing it to Frenchie the fucking experience up. [laughter] He could’ve said “cheese,” he knows the fucking word’s cheese. Everything else he said in English, and then he had to say fucking fromage. Fuck that cunt. [laughter] You’re telling me… You’re telling me that he’s, uh… he’s learned the entire English language but he’s just one word short? [laughter] I don’t like that.', 'I’ll be honest with you here, and this is being recorded, and I’m happy to say this to the whole world. My most hated group in society… is Italian Americans. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'And… And… And… Look, this is a comedy show, so if there are any Italian Americans in the room with us this evening, please know that you’re not welcome.', '[laughter] [whistling and applause]', 'You’re a fucking painful bunch of people. [laughter] Pick a fucking accent. Either go Italian or go American, but don’t flip-flop. [laughter] You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the waiter will seem normal, and then he’ll fucking change, right? You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the guy will go, “Hey, enjoying your meal? It’s good, right? My mother, she used to make it with the mozzarell…” And you’re like… [laughter] “What the fuck happened to that word, cunt?” You… It’s like he had a fucking stroke in the middle of the fucking word. Mozzarell… Fuck you. [laughter]', 'That’s why I got to give it up for the Asians. I like the Asians. [cheering] They pick an accent, and they fucking stick to it. [laughter] The Asians either go full Asian, or they go full American. They don’t go back and forth. [laughter] You’ll never be in an Asian restaurant and have the waiter walk up and go, “Hey, you enjoyed that? You should try it with some soy-soy.” No, they never do that. [laughter] So kudos, Asians. Kudos. [cheering]', 'Anyway, so he rocks up with his fucking cart of cheese. There’s some soft cheeses there, some Camemberts and Bries and whatnot. The most dangerous cheeses of them all. [laughter] And I look at the cheese. And now, this– this girl, she does not know of my condition. [laughter] And I look at the cheeses, I look up at him, and I went, “How long… [laughter] …is the rest of the meal?” [laughter] And he said, “Uh, maybe, uh, 20 minutes.” I went, “Twenty minutes, I’ve got a 15-minute drive. [laughter] Fromage me.” [laughter] And I got myself a big plate of cheese, and I fucking caned that cunt. I fucking ate all that.', 'We got another couple of courses, they have two dessert courses. One of the courses, the dessert courses, might as well have just been called “lactose.” [laughter] It was a lactose crumble, next to a lactose foam, with a lactose reduction, with a scoop of ice cream, then they freeze-dried some lactose crumble table-side and sprinkled it on top. And I looked at it, and I was like this, “In for a penny, in for a pound.” [laughter] And I ate that bowl of lactose as well.', 'Now, what I didn’t mention is the girl I’m on the date with, she is a very petite girl. She had given up around course six. [laughter] I had also eaten her plate of fromage. [laughter] And her bowl of lactose. [laughter] Lactose is now coursing through my veins. I am on borrowed time. [laughter] And so I’m sitting there, knowing. I’m just sort of like, “All right, we’ll be good here. We’ll be good.” You know? I’m listening to her. “Oh, that’s interesting.” [laughter] And then the waiter comes up and goes, “Would you like a coffee?” And I went, “No! [laughter] Just the check, please.” [laughter] So he gets me the check. Now, we’re gonna go back to my place. Now, I’d been on a few dates with this girl, we’d always gone back to her place. This time was the first night she was gonna come back to my house. I was happy about going back to my place ’cause I know where all the toilets are, I know the distance. There’s a lot of things that were going on there. And because she was staying at my place, she goes to me, she goes, “Oh, we have to stop at the pharmacy… because there’s a-a-a cream that I need, like a lotion type of thing.” And I said, “That you need?” [laughter] And I-I-I said, I said, “Are you sure you don’t want it?” [laughter] And she goes, “No, I… No, I need it.” And I said, “I don’t know if you know the difference between wants and needs. [laughter] Like, if you need it, that means that you’ll die… [laughter] …if you don’t have it. So… Do you need it?” [laughter] And she claimed to need it.', 'So… we drove off to the pharmacy. We get in there, right? We walk in this Rite Aid, and there’s just this wall of fucking lotions and that type of stuff, and I thought she needed it so she would know which one to grab. [laughter] But she’s just sort of looking at them, like this. Right? And I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. -[laughter] -Like this. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And she can’t pick one. Now, this is the thing, she has to get a lotion. I don’t understand what’s going on with the whole lotion thing with women, right? I… Okay, I’ve lived with, uh, six girlfriends in my life. [laughter] In my… In my life, I’ve lived with six women, and all six of them have left me. [laughter] And sooner or later, I’m going to blame myself. [laughter] But not today. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'Now… [cheering and applause] Now, every single woman I’ve ever lived with has a nighttime ritual, where they… See, I have a bedtime ritual. What I do is I go to the bathroom, I have a piss, I brush my teeth, I go to bed. [laughter] I’ve recently figured out that I could do them at the same time. [laughter] I have a piss and I brush my teeth, and I spit over, like that… Now, but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for, like, 20 minutes, and you close the door. And then you come out, and the last thing you do is you’re sort of… you’re rubbing something here. [laughter] And then you go like this. [laughter] And then you get into bed, and you tell me what I’ve done wrong that day. [laughter] [applause] And that’s your little nighttime routine. [laughter] Now, I don’t know what goes on in that room. [laughter] But I assume, I can’t be positive, but I assume you are covering your body head to toe in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence. [laughter] Now, I’m 42 years old. Um… I-I wear makeup for work. Like, when I’m on TV, they put makeup on me. I never even wipe it off, I just fucking… They give me a towelette, and I go, “Ah, don’t worry about it.” Then… [laughter] It goes away over a week, and they put it back on. [laughter] Apart from that, I-I’ve worn sunscreen, but I’ve never put anything else on my face. Nothing else my entire life. Um, I’m arguably an alcoholic. [laughter] I… I used to be a heavy smoker. I’ve been a cocaine addict. [cheering] [laughter] And my skin is fucking flawless. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And you want to know why? Because my skin learned at a very young age… [laughter] …that it couldn’t rely on me. [laughter] My skin knew that I was not gonna help it, so it was like, “All right… We’re going to have to produce our own oils if we’re gonna keep shit together.” Where women’s skin… Women’s skin… Every day, women’s skin is like this, “I haven’t had my special cream.” [laughter] And that’s why you all age so horribly. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'Yeah, I-I don’t… I don’t do… as many misogynistic jokes as I used to, but I like to whip one in there every now and then. [laughter] It’s funny because I didn’t… I used to do more back in the day. But what happened was, in our society, people started getting angry at me because they didn’t know I was joking. Even though my job description would say… [laughter] …that I was possibly joking. [laughter] So this is what happens now with comedians. For some reason, we’re enemy number one. Every time we do a joke that you don’t like, you all go, “Why did you say that?” “Why…” I get asked at interviews, “Why would you say that joke?” And you go, “I thought it was going to be funny.” [laughter] It’s fucking ridiculous. I’m in trouble now for jokes that I did fucking ten years ago. People ring me up and go, “You said this joke ten years ago.” Now, our job as comedians is, okay, if the line’s here, our job is to go right up to the line, that’s our fucking job. To take risks. To gamble, if you will. Now, what happens when you gamble? You don’t always win. [laughter] Otherwise it wouldn’t be called fucking “gambling.” [laughter] So, what happens is we go all the way up to the line, right, which is fine. So, on my specials, I have jokes that have gotten through standards and practices and lawyers and everything, and still gotten on fucking Netflix, and then you watch it years later, and you’re fucking angry. Well, go fuck yourself, right? Because…', '[cheering and applause]', \"Because… When I told the joke, the line was here, and it was socially acceptable, right? Now you moved the line back to here, so I won’t go there anymore, I won’t, but the line’s here. But you can’t get angry because you moved the line and then the fucking joke was over here. [laughter and applause] And then… And then you have the audacity to ask me to maybe apologize for a fucking joke. Here’s the thing, I wanted the joke to work. Sometimes you tell a joke and it doesn’t fucking work. And then people go, “Why did you do that?” You go, “I tried to make the joke work, but it didn’t fucking work, and now you’re all upset with me.” [laughter] It’s like if a pilot smashes a plane into fucking the side of a mountain. You don’t go, “Why did you do that?” [laughter] He’ll go, “My intention was to land the plane safely. [laughter] But it turns out I failed at my job. But I didn’t… I didn’t wake up in the morning going, ‘Smash it!'” [laughter]\", 'See, it’s like, I watched Dave Chappelle’s special. I watched his special. I thought it was fucking great. [cheering and applause] It was hilarious. And people got upset, and they got upset by different jokes in it. They get… See, here’s the thing. I didn’t enjoy every joke in his special. Some of the things he said, I didn’t even agree with. But you know what happened? When I watched the jokes I didn’t enjoy, I got over it because I’m not a fucking pussy. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'All right? And I just listened to the ones I fucking enjoyed. See, he said that he thought that Michael Jackson didn’t fuck kids. Eh. [laughter] I think Michael Jackson did fuck kids. [laughter] That’s how me and Dave differ. [laughter]', 'A lot of people have stopped listening to Michael Jackson’s music. They go, “I won’t listen to it anymore. I won’t listen to it anymore.” I still listen to it. [laughter] But I only listen to the Jackson 5. [laughter] ‘Cause if he was fucking kids back then, it was just experimenting, and there’s nothing wrong with that. [laughter] I go all the way to “Blame It on the Boogie,” and I fucking call it a day. [laughter]', 'So, look… [laughter] What I’m trying to tell you is… she couldn’t pick which cream she wanted. [laughter] And she’s looking at all the different creams. I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. [laughter] And I think to myself, “Fuck it, I’ve got to have a shit.” Now, there’s a bathroom in the back of the, uh, pharmacy, so I duck off.', 'Now, at this point of the story, I got to tell you… all right, that this girl’s a germophobe. It’s vital to the story that she’s a germophobe. Now, we may have some people in the room who identify as germophobes and, to those people… go fuck yourself.', '[laughter, cheering, and applause]', 'I’ve… I’ve never met a person in my life who’s interesting who’s a fucking germophobe. You’re always boring cunts who tell us all the time that you’re a fucking germophobe. Being a germophobe is doing a lot of heavy lifting for your shit fucking personality. [laughter] How dare you act like we’re all diseased. Every time we shake your hand, you go, “I-I can’t because… eh…” Every time you cook with a germophobe, you cook and put some scraps in the bin, you go, “Hey, can you take that out for the trash for me?” And they’re like, “I’d love to, but I can’t. [laughter] Because I’m a germophobe.” And you’re like, “The rest of us are loving it.” You lick the bin, “Aah.” [laughter] You’re not special.', 'While I’m at it, people with peanut allergies can fuck off an’ all. [laughter, cheering, and applause] Now, I’m not saying that there aren’t people with severe peanut allergies. There truly are. There’s people who will die if they eat a fucking peanut. What I’m saying is it’s your fucking problem. [laughter] The rest of us don’t have to be involved. Right, like, have you ever been on a plane lately, and they go like this, they go, “Uh, on today’s flight, we will not be serving peanuts, as there’s a person on the flight with a severe peanut allergy.” And you’re like, “All right, well, don’t give them to them, then.” [laughter] How fucking weak-willed are these cunts? “Oh, I know it will kill me, but the salty goodness…” [laughter] Like, what do they think the rest of us are going to fucking do? Go to the air stewardess, “Uh, excuse me, uh, who has that peanut allergy?” [laughter] [laughter] What do you think’s gonna happen if someone next to you eats a fucking peanut? Do you think peanut particles will get in the fucking air? Guess what? These flights fly back and forth and back and forth all fucking day. In between, they hardly clean the planes. Do you think they’d go on with a special peanut– de-peanut-ing machine and fucking fill the fucking air? [laughter] See, you know what I do? Every time when I’m on a flight where they serve peanuts, what I do is I get six or seven peanuts, and I wedge them down the back of the fucking seat. [laughter] And if someone ever dies, I’ll be the first person to say, “I was wrong.” [laughter]', 'Now, I talked earlier about, like, how I did one misogynistic joke, and how– how, at the moment now, I-I-I don’t know if people know that I’m fucking joking. It’s become very odd now, this tension that we have about what’s right and what’s wrong. I was on a plane and this fucking… This woman was trying to put a bag in the overhead luggage, and she was shaking, and she can’t do it. And I went to help her, and she just looked at me and went, “No, no,” like that. [laughter] And it’s, like, now I’m in trouble for trying to do a nice thing. That used to be my one move. [laughter] I used to open doors, I used to lift bags, I used to stand up for pregnant people on buses. That was my fucking gig. That’s what I had going. -[laughter] And now, because I tried to help her, she’s, like… She’s, like, angry at me? Like I’m trying to do a male patriarchy thing, where I can lift this better than you. So I just told her to fuck off. [laughter] And… turns out, she’s just a woman with Parkinson’s, and she did need my help. [laughter] But that scenario could’ve been different is what I’m saying. [laughter]', 'Like, I was in a movie… I was in a movie with my son. We were watching… A couple of years ago, we were watching the Ghostbusters movie, the new one with the female cast. Watching Ghostbusters. My son, he’s four at the time, and he turns to me watching Ghostbusters, and he goes, “This movie’s not as good as the other Ghostbusters.” And I went, “Shut up, shh. [laughter] You’re not allowed to say that. This movie’s every bit as good as the other Ghostbusters. We’ll talk about it in the car.” [laughter] You know, and on reflection, that movie wasn’t as good. [laughter] It was a shit fucking movie. [laughter] Wasn’t funny, the action sequences weren’t good, it was a fucking shit film. It wasn’t shit because women were in it. It was just shit because it was shit. [laughter] You know what I mean? Like, ’cause that cast… Paul Feig is the director. He directed Bridesmaids, one of my top ten comedies. The rest of the cast was from that movie, they’d made good films together. This one was just a misfire. But the weird thing that happened was no one went to see that film, and then all of a sudden, men were pigs, men are fucking misogynistic assholes because that film didn’t do good. No. It didn’t do good because you women didn’t fucking see it either. If you went and saw the movie… If you went and saw the movie, it would have been a success. But you didn’t fucking see it, then you got angry at us for not fucking seeing it. [laughter] Do you want to know why it didn’t do well? It’s an action comedy, and if you go to any marketing company that talks about how they sell things, action comedies primarily are enjoyed by men. There might be exceptions to the rule, but primarily men like action comedies. Do you want to know why? Because we’re funny, and we do things, and… [laughter] And… And women like dramas because you cause drama. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'So my point is… stop remaking our fucking movies. Leave our movies alone. We don’t remake your films. You don’t see Brad Pitt and George Clooney getting together to make Mystic fucking Pizza of the Sisterhood of the Ya-Ya Fuckhead Traveling Pants Movie. [laughter] We leave your shit alone. [laughter] Although there should be some films that should be remade with, you know, different casts. Like, one of my favorite movies from my childhood was, uh, Nine to Five. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda. Fantastic. It still stands up today. It’s about three women, they have a boss who’s a fucking pig. Like, it’s even poignant right now. They have a boss who’s a pig. So what they do is they drug him, and they put him in bondage gear, and they hang him from the roof of one of their garages for three weeks. It’s a fun film. [laughter] You know, they should do that with a male cast, right? So, there’s a woman, you put her in the position of power. [laughter] The three employees don’t like it, so they drug her, and they put her in bondage gear, and they hang her from the roof of one of their garages. It’s just a fun film. [laughter]', 'Another movie that needs an opposite remake: Brokeback Mountain. [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'That movie’s… It needs it! [laughter] The original film is a couple of blokes, they’re working on the land, they ran out of conversation. So they went into a tent, and they fucked each other in the ass. [laughter] My film, it’s a couple of young lasses, they’re working on the land, they’re doing a man’s job. They get bored, so they go into a tent, and they finger-bang each other. [laughter] [laughter] My version doesn’t even need a tent. [laughter]', 'But one of the things that’s happening in cinema at the moment is, and I think we can all agree on this… Okay, so… So we’re done with blackface people. Stop doing that. People don’t like it. If-If you’re getting ready for Halloween and you think, “I might do blackface,” just don’t. [laughter] It’s so much easier to not do blackface. [laughter] Like you don’t have to do anything. Just save yourself time. See, the thing is, with actors now you’ve got in movies… I think we’ve all agreed that you can’t play outside your race. It goes back to, like, Mickey Rooney playing an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Don’t play outside your race. You can only play your race. I think we can all agree on that now. Now, there’s another thing happening now, where the gays are getting upset if heterosexuals are playing gay people on film. I’m not sure about that, but I’m open to discussion.', 'But here’s the thing that’s really fucking pissing me off. Taron Edgerton, or Egerton, or whatever, he played Elton John and Eddie the Eagle. Two of the ugliest cunts that have ever lived. [laughter] He’s really good-looking. I don’t fucking like that. [laughter] He’s playing uglyface. How many ugly actors would like that fucking opportunity? [yelling] Do the good-looking people need fucking everything? [laughter] Like, Charlize Theron fucking gains 30 pounds, and all they say is, “How brave.” [laughter] You know what’s brave? Being ugly every single fucking day.', '[cheering and applause]', 'So I decide to go off to the toilet, right? And I’m going off… [laughter] And she goes, “Where are you going?” And there’s no point lying anymore, so I just went like this, “Um… I have to shit myself.” [laughter] And she goes, “If you take a shit in a public toilet, then I’ll never fuck you again.” I was like, [exhales] [laughter] “It’s a very good argument. That’s a… That’s what you call a quandary.” [laughter] So, I went, “All right, but just fucking hurry up.” So now I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” jog. I’m like, “Come on. [laughter] Pick a fucking cream. Pick a cream, any cream. They’re all good. All of these creams are good.” She’s not hurrying up, so I did what every man has done in a relationship. Right? And there’s a few men in this room that probably did it this evening to get here on time. This is how you hurry up your wife or your girlfriend. Every man does this. This is our special move. We go out… and we sit in the car. [laughter] And we think, “This’ll send a strong message.” [laughter] Now, I assume women are like, “Ah, thank fuck he’s gone to sit in the car.” [laughter] So, I’m sitting in the car and I do this move, where I’ve leant like this, I leant all the way down, and I’m trying to breathe through it, like I’m in, like, a Lamaze class, like… [exhales] [exhales] And the reason I’m sitting like this is because my theory is if I lay flat like this, the shit won’t come out as quickly -because of gravity, you see? [laughter] If I sit upright, the shit has an easier way to fall.', '[man] Yeah!', 'And also, sitting like this, I’m clenching my ass cheeks together. [laughter] Because if the shit gets past the sphincter, it won’t get past the impenetrable barrier that is me clenching my ass cheeks together. Because I’m a fucking genius. [laughter] And I’m sitting there, and I’m watching her through the window of the pharmacy. [laughter] And she selects the cream, but then she stops a bit. Right? Then she goes back to get another cream. So I’ve got to hurry this up, so I start honking, just… Honk! Honk! She looks out like she’s really angry with me. Then she’s going to the counter. I think, “Oh, good, she’s coming.” Then she just, like, bumps into a friend. [laughter] Starts fucking talking to someone. So, I thought, “I’d better step this up a gear.” So, I put the window down, and I lean my head out the window, and every time the sliding doors open like this… [laughter] …I went, “I’m gonna shit myself! [laughter] I’m gonna shit myself!” [laughter] Now… I forget that I’m off the telly. I don’t think about it on a regular basis, right? So, I’m leaning out the window, yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself,” and this 14-year-old kid skateboards by and goes, “Good luck with that, Jim.”', '[laughter] [applause]', 'So I’m sitting there yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself.” Eventually she comes out, she gets in the car, and, like, obviously she’s upset. She has reason. I have been yelling, “I’m going to shit myself,” and honking the horn. [laughter] She sits next to me and she goes, “I cannot believe…” And I went, “No time to fight! [laughter] This is not a drill.” [laughter] And I fucking fishtail out of the fucking car park. Now I’m in Ventura, and I’m whizzing through traffic. She’s holding on, fucking… The cream’s bouncing around. I see the Golden Arches, I see McDonald’s. I turned to her, I said, “Could I please have a shit in the McDonald’s? [laughter] McDonald’s are renowned for how clean they keep their toilets. I won’t even sit on the seat. I’ll just hover and spray.” [laughter] To that, I received a firm, “No.” [laughter] So I have to make a decision. My house is five minutes away. Her house is three minutes away. I-I make a call. I’ve got to go to her house, it’s the only way I’ll make it, right?', 'Now, this… This kills me. Every day I think about this, right? If I went to her house to begin with, I never would’ve had to stop to get the cream. [laughter] So, anyway, we get into her house… we get in the driveway, she has a long driveway. I park the car. I get out. I’m already like this, “Come on!” “Come on!” [laughter] She’s got the keys, so none of my running’s helping. She’s just fucking in heels, just going through her bag. I’m going, “Come on!” Now she’s stopped being angry, she just finds this hilarious. [laughter] She’s just laughing. We get to the door. Right, now, you know when you’ve really… you’ve… you really have needed to do a shit? It could be five minutes, it could be five hours, but there was an amount of time where you were desperate to do a shit. Then you get to within 12 feet of the toilet. [laughter] And your asshole starts to reward itself… [laughter] for all the good work that you’ve put in. [laughter] Your asshole goes, “Yeah, we did it! [laughter] We did it! We did it as a team! And that’s my favorite thing: that we did it together!” [laughter] ‘Cause you always get to the toilet, you always go… “Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!” Pooooooof! [laughter and applause] You never go… seat… Poof! No. Why is it that you always just made it? You’re not that lucky. There aren’t that many coincidences in the world… [laughter] …that you always just made it. It’s that your asshole has its own brain and a, like, Pavlovian response. So anyway… I get up to the door, and I’m going, “Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!” And I’m, like, really yelling. She walks up, she gets the keys out, she’s laughing. She goes to put the keys in the door, she drops the keys. -[laughter] -[woman] Oh! The keys hit the ground, and I shit myself.', '[laughter] [applause]', 'And this isn’t just like a little warning squirt of, like, “All right, there’s more where this came from.” And it wasn’t like a full evacuation either. It wasn’t just like a full… “Pooof” like this. It was the weirdest thing. It was just shit coming out of me in a steady meter, just… [laughter] No pushing. [laughter] No pushing. Everything from liquids to solids and everything in between. [laughter] And I’d gone from being all “Aaagh!” to just a calmness… [laughter] …came over me. I was just… [laughter] And my jeans are filling up. [laughter] And instantly, the… the smell of human fecal matter has filled the air. And for the first time, she gets her ass into gear and she goes, “Oh, fuck!” And she grabs the keys… [laughter] And I went, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [laughter] No point hurrying anymore. [laughter] You take your time.” [laughter]', '[cheering and applause]', 'All right. Now, before I go, I’m gonna tell a very, very quick little story. Um… My mother passed away a few months ago, and, um, when my mother died… Look, my mother, uh was never… Yeah, look, here’s the deal. My mother’s not a– wasn’t a funny woman. She had no… no sense of humor, never found me funny. She never watched anything that I did and went, “That was funny.” But she was always… [laughter] She was always very supportive of me. And, you know, the only per… she was the only one in my life, the only one, that I bagged on my mother so much, I called her Gunta, she was the butt of so many fucking jokes that I said. And I’ll give her this, she never complained, not fucking once. Not once.', '[cheering and applause]', 'So… I’d like to tell one story where she comes out of it a little bit cooler. Right?', 'Now, when I was about 13 and my brother was about 17, we were home watching, uh, Star Wars. Right? We were home watching Star Wars. I was on the Throne of Misery, my brother was on the couch, watching Star Wars. My brother Scott, who’s a fucking nutjob, right, he turns to me and he goes, “Hey, Jim, get me a Coke.” And I went, “Get your own fucking Coke, I’m not gonna get you a Coke.” And he goes, “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” [laughter] “What? What?” [laughter] “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” I go, “I’m not getting you a fucking Coke.” And he’s going, “So you’d rather I just pissed on the carpet?” I go, “I guess that’s what I’m fucking telling you.” [laughter] And my brother walks to the middle of the living room, stands in front of me, gets out his cock, starts pissing on the carpet, and he looks at me and he goes, “I don’t know why you constantly find the need to cause trouble. [laughter] It would have been so easy for you just to get a Coke, but, no, not Jim, has to be difficult.” Then he shakes his cock, puts it away, goes back, lies down. Now, this is the bit that fucking kills me. [laughter] He doesn’t get a Coke. [laughter] So, I was sitting there, you know, 40 degrees Celsius, no air conditioning, fucking… a puddle of urine in the middle of the living room, just steaming upwards. Now we’re onto about… We’re probably on Return of the Jedi by now. My mom comes in, and she does that thing that parents do when they have no words. She walks in, just to see the urine in the middle, and she went like this, “Why? [laughter] Who… Who would… Who would… Why?” [laughter] And then she went, “Every fucking day it’s something different. Every day.” [laughter] And then she went, “Who did this?” And I didn’t want to get in trouble, so I went, “Scott did it.” And she turned to Scott and she goes, “What did you do that for?” And he went, “I told Jim to get me a Coke, or I’d piss on the carpet.” [laughter] And my mother turns to me and goes… [imitates hard slap] [laughter] “Why didn’t you get him a Coke? You know he’s fucking mental.”', '[laughter]', 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.', '[cheering and applause]', 'Good night.

', 'People are fucking nuts. This country is full of nitwits and assholes. Do you ever notice that? Oh, my goodness, yes. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Nitwits, assholes, fuck ups, scumbags, jerk offs and dipshits. And they all vote. They all vote, yeah. In fact, sometimes you get the impression They’re the only ones who vote. You can usually tell who’s been doing the voting by looking at the fucking election returns. Man, it sure ain’t me out there wasting my time with a meaningless activity like that. You know those people on the “Jerry Springer Show”, those are the average Americans. Oh, yeah, believe me. Below average can’t get on the show. Can’t get on. Below average is sitting home watching that shit on TV, getting ready to out and vote, filling out their sample ballot. People are fucking dumb.', 'You can say what you want about this country, and I love this place. I love the freedoms we used to have. I love it. I love that. I love it when it didn’t take a fucking catastrophe to get us to care for one another. I love the fact that we’re on camera all the time from all angles. But, you know, you can say what you want about America. And I say I love this place. I wouldn’t have it any other way, wouldn’t live in any other time in history in any other place. But say what you want about America. Land of the free, home of the brave. We’ve got some dumb-ass motherfuckers floating around this country. Dumb-ass motherfuckers, you know. Now, obviously that doesn’t include this audience. I understand that. You seem intelligent and perceptive but the rest of them, holy jumping fucking shit balls. Dumber than a second coat of paint.', 'Now, this ain’t just ranting and raving. This ain’t just blowing off steam. I got a little evidence to support my claim. It just seems to me seems to me, that only a really low IQ population could have taken this beautiful continent, this magnificent American landscape that we inherited… Well, actually, we stole it from the Mexicans and the Indians but. Hey, it was nice when we stole it. It looked pretty good. It was pristine. Paradise. Have you seen it lately? Have you taken a good look at it lately? It’s fucking embarrassing.', 'Only a nation of unenlightened half-wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today, a shopping mall. A big, fucking shopping mall. You know that. That’s all you got. That’s all you got here, folks. Mile after mile of mall after mall. Many, many malls. Major malls and mini malls. They put the mini malls in between the major malls. And in between the mini malls they put the mini marts. And in between the mini marts. You’ve got the car lots, gas stations, muffler shops, Laundromats, cheap hotels, fast food joints, strip clubs and dirty bookstores. America the beautiful. One big transcontinental commercial cesspool.', 'And how do the people feel about all this? How do the people feel about living in a coast-to-coast shopping mall? Well, they think it’s JUST FUCKING DANDY! They think it is as cool as can be. Because Americans love the mall. They love the mall. That’s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time. Shopping and eating. Millions of semiconscious Americans day after day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating. Especially eating. Americans love to eat. They are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food. Hot dogs, corn dogs, triple bacon cheeseburgers, deep-fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheesewhiz, mayonnaise-soaked barbecue, mozzarella patty melts. America will eat anything. Anything. Anything. Shit,if you were selling sautéed raccoons assholes on a stick, Americans would buy them and eat them. Especially if you dipped them in butter and put a little salsa on them.', 'This country is big-time pig time. Forget the bald eagle. You know what the national emblem of this country ought to be? A big bowl of macaroni and cheese. A BIG BOWL. Because everything in this country is king size. King size, extra large and SUPER JUMBO. Especially the fucking people! Have you seen some of the people in this country? Have you taken a good look at some of these big, fat motherfuckers walking around? Big, fat motherfuckers. Oh, my God. Huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of interstate buses. The people in this country are immense. Massive bellies. Monstrous thighs and big, fat fucking asses. And if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them, you’ll look at one of them and you begin to wonder, How does this woman take a shit? How does she shit? And even more frightening, How does she wipe her ass? Can she even locate her asshole? She must require assistance. Are paramedics trained in this field? And standing right next to her. Of course. With a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of pie is her clueless fucking husband Joe Six Pack. With his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckle. This guy ain’t seen his dick since the Nixon administration. And if you stand there and you look at the two of them. You begin to wonder to yourself, Do these people fuck? Is this man actually capable of fucking this woman? It doesn’t seem structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration. Maybe they’re in that “Cirque du Soleil” or something. I’m telling you the people in this country – every one of them – is 50 pounds overweight. They are GARGANTUAN.', 'And in the summertime – God help us – in the summertime they will all want to wear short pants. Jesus Lord, Protector of All That is Good and Holy, deliver us from fat people in short pants. They all got short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Every one of them has got two dumbass kids with them. And the whole family is wearing T-shirts, and every one of them has got the same T-shirt… “I’m with stupid.” Apparently in this country, the Stupids are an extended family.', 'And besides wearing them T-shirts. Everyone in the family has got on a backpack. They got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid shit. And the reason they got to carry their stupid shit strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold food. And to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting shit they ate that day. And… Another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid shit. They ain’t got enough stupid shit at home. They just had a stupid shit sale, they’re gonna buy more.', 'They’re going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big, fat, ugly, oversized SUV that’s got plenty of room in it. Plenty of room in it for stupid shit and lots of room left over for these big, fat, ugly motherfuckers to get them home. Stopping on the way, of course, for jelly roll and fried dough.', 'These people, these people are efficient, professional, compulsive consumers. It’s their civic duty. Consumption. It’s the new national pastime. Fuck baseball. It’s consumption. The only true lasting American value that’s left. Buying things. Buying things. People spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need. MONEY THEY DON’T HAVE ON THINGS THEY DON’T NEED. So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18 percent interest on something that cost 12.50. And they didn’t like it when they got it home anyway! Not too bright, folks. Not too fucking bright.', 'But if you talk to one of them about this. If you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally, and you talk to them about the low IQ’s and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions. Right away they start talking about education. That’s the big answer to everything. Education. They say “We need more money for education. We need more books. More teachers. More classrooms. More schools. We need more testing for the kids”. You say to them, “Well, you know, we’ve tried all of that and the kids still can’t pass the tests”. They say, “Don’t you worry about that. We’re going to lower the passing grades”. And that’s what they do in a lot of these schools now. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass. More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody’s happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a fucking pencil. Got a pencil? Get the fuck in there, it’s physics. Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do. “EDUCAATION”. Politicians know that word. They USE it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things, the flag, the Bible and children. “No child left behind. No child left behind.” Oh, really? Well, it wasn’t long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start. Head start. Left behind. Someone is losing fucking ground here.', 'But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. There’s a reason that education sucks. And it’s the same reason that it will never ever. Ever be fixed. It’s never going to get any better. Don’t look for it. Be happy with what you got. BECAUSE THE OWNERS OF THIS COUNTRY DON’T WANT THAT. I’m talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians… they’re irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. YOU DON’T. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. YOU HAVE OWNERS. THEY OWN YOU. THEY OWN *EVERYTHING*! They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls. They got the judges in their back pocket. And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear!', 'THEY’VE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS! They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed. Well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interest. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want OBEDIENT WORKERS. OBEDIENT WORKERS. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits. The end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.', 'And now, they’re coming for your SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back! So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street! And you know something, they’ll get it… they’ll get it ALL from you sooner or later… because they own this fucking place! It’s a BIG CLUB…AND YOU AIN’T IN IT! You and I are not in the big club! By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head. And their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy… The table is tilted. Folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good. Honest. Hard- working people. White collar. Blue collar. It doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on.', 'Good, honest, hard-working people continue… these are people of modest means. Continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them. THEY DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU. AT ALL. AT ALL. AT ALL! Yeah. You know. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth… It’s called the American dream. Because you have to be asleep to believe it.', 'Your email address will not be published.

      "['Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers.', 'This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens.', 'The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!”', 'So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers.', 'So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth.', 'You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird!', 'I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.', 'Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.”', 'I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit?', 'So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right?', 'But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free.', 'So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe.', 'I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die.', 'I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity.', 'But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner.', 'But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead?', 'But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks!', 'So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go.', 'That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!”', 'And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much.', 'I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing.

They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not.

Only a nation of unenlightened half-wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today, a shopping mall. A big, fucking shopping mall. You know that. That’s all you got. That’s all you got here, folks. Mile after mile of mall after mall. Many, many malls. Major malls and mini malls. They put the mini malls in between the major malls. And in between the mini malls they put the mini marts. And in between the mini marts. You’ve got the car lots, gas stations, muffler shops, Laundromats, cheap hotels, fast food joints, strip clubs and dirty bookstores. America the beautiful. One big transcontinental commercial cesspool. And how do the people feel about all this? How do the people feel about living in a coast-to-coast shopping mall? Well, they think it’s JUST FUCKING DANDY! They think it is as cool as can be. Because Americans love the mall. They love the mall. That’s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time. Shopping and eating. Millions of semiconscious Americans day after day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating. Especially eating. Americans love to eat. They are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food. Hot dogs, corn dogs, triple bacon cheeseburgers, deep-fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheesewhiz, mayonnaise-soaked barbecue, mozzarella patty melts. America will eat anything. Anything. Anything. Shit,if you were selling sautéed raccoons assholes on a stick, Americans would buy them and eat them. Especially if you dipped them in butter and put a little salsa on them. This country is big-time pig time. Forget the bald eagle. You know what the national emblem of this country ought to be? A big bowl of macaroni and cheese. A BIG BOWL. Because everything in this country is king size. King size, extra large and SUPER JUMBO. Especially the fucking people! Have you seen some of the people in this country? Have you taken a good look at some of these big, fat motherfuckers walking around? Big, fat motherfuckers. Oh, my God. Huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of interstate buses. The people in this country are immense. Massive bellies. Monstrous thighs and big, fat fucking asses. And if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them, you’ll look at one of them and you begin to wonder, How does this woman take a shit? How does she shit? And even more frightening, How does she wipe her ass? Can she even locate her asshole? She must require assistance. Are paramedics trained in this field? And standing right next to her. Of course. With a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of pie is her clueless fucking husband Joe Six Pack. With his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckle. This guy ain’t seen his dick since the Nixon administration. And if you stand there and you look at the two of them. You begin to wonder to yourself, Do these people fuck? Is this man actually capable of fucking this woman? It doesn’t seem structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration. Maybe they’re in that “Cirque du Soleil” or something. I’m telling you the people in this country – every one of them – is 50 pounds overweight. They are GARGANTUAN. And in the summertime – God help us – in the summertime they will all want to wear short pants. Jesus Lord, Protector of All That is Good and Holy, deliver us from fat people in short pants. They all got short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Every one of them has got two dumbass kids with them. And the whole family is wearing T-shirts, and every one of them has got the same T-shirt… “I’m with stupid.” Apparently in this country, the Stupids are an extended family. And besides wearing them T-shirts. Everyone in the family has got on a backpack. They got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid shit. And the reason they got to carry their stupid shit strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold food. And to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting shit they ate that day. And… Another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid shit. They ain’t got enough stupid shit at home. They just had a stupid shit sale, they’re gonna buy more. They’re going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big, fat, ugly, oversized SUV that’s got plenty of room in it. Plenty of room in it for stupid shit and lots of room left over for these big, fat, ugly motherfuckers to get them home. Stopping on the way, of course, for jelly roll and fried dough. These people, these people are efficient, professional, compulsive consumers. It’s their civic duty. Consumption. It’s the new national pastime. Fuck baseball. It’s consumption. The only true lasting American value that’s left. Buying things. Buying things. People spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need. MONEY THEY DON’T HAVE ON THINGS THEY DON’T NEED. So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18 percent interest on something that cost 12.50. And they didn’t like it when they got it home anyway! Not too bright, folks. Not too fucking bright. But if you talk to one of them about this. If you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally, and you talk to them about the low IQ’s and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions. Right away they start talking about education. That’s the big answer to everything. Education. They say “We need more money for education. We need more books. More teachers. More classrooms. More schools. We need more testing for the kids”. You say to them, “Well, you know, we’ve tried all of that and the kids still can’t pass the tests”. They say, “Don’t you worry about that. We’re going to lower the passing grades”. And that’s what they do in a lot of these schools now. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass. More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody’s happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a fucking pencil. Got a pencil? Get the fuck in there, it’s physics. Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do. “EDUCAATION”. Politicians know that word. They USE it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things, the flag, the Bible and children. “No child left behind. No child left behind.” Oh, really? Well, it wasn’t long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start. Head start. Left behind. Someone is losing fucking ground here. But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. There’s a reason that education sucks. And it’s the same reason that it will never ever. Ever be fixed. It’s never going to get any better. Don’t look for it. Be happy with what you got. BECAUSE THE OWNERS OF THIS COUNTRY DON’T WANT THAT. I’m talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians… they’re irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. YOU DON’T. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. YOU HAVE OWNERS. THEY OWN YOU. THEY OWN *EVERYTHING*! They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls. They got the judges in their back pocket. And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear! THEY’VE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS! They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed. Well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interest. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want OBEDIENT WORKERS. OBEDIENT WORKERS. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits. The end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now, they’re coming for your SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back! So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street! And you know something, they’ll get it… they’ll get it ALL from you sooner or later… because they own this fucking place! It’s a BIG CLUB…AND YOU AIN’T IN IT! You and I are not in the big club! By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head. And their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy… The table is tilted. Folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good. Honest. Hard- working people. White collar. Blue collar. It doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good, honest, hard-working people continue… these are people of modest means. Continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them. THEY DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU. AT ALL. AT ALL. AT ALL! Yeah. You know. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth… It’s called the American dream. Because you have to be asleep to believe it. Your email address will not be published.

       "      <td>Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes. Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go, “Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete, he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took 45 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would! I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long. Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes, but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28, proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t… burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context, it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said, “Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went, “Fucking brilliant, mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went, “Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night! Prolefeed.

       "      <td>[rock music plays] [cheering and applause] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Jefferies! [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause continues] Hello, Boston! How you doing? Thank you for that. Thank you for that. You all getting fucked up? [cheering] I’m not drinking. I got water. -I can’t drink like I used to drink. Okay? [audience] Aww. I used to drink– I used to be a daily drinker. I used to be five drinks, every day, seven days a week, which is 35 drinks a week. Which the FDA of America says that means I’m an alcoholic. They say anything over 20 drinks makes you an alcoholic. Bullshit. [laughter] That’s less than three drinks a fucking day. That’s a reasonable amount of fucking drinking. You can have three drinks a day. There’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t have a problem. [laughter] Two lines of coke a day isn’t a coke problem. [laughter] It isn’t a coke problem. That’s less than a gram a week. [laughter] You know why I stopped drinking so much is because I cracked open a beer, and my son, he was five at the time, he looked up at me, he went, “Daddy, are you drinking again?” [laughter] I’m like, “Where the fuck did that come from, you little…?” [laughter] Like, very clearly it was from the woman who I gave a house to, but I was like… [laughter] So, I don’t… I don’t drink… I don’t drink like that anymore. I don’t drink, ’cause I’m a good dad, you know? So, what I do now is I just drink one day a week, but I still get my 35 in. [laughter] That’s how society has pushed me. [cheering and applause] That’s why if you ever see, like, a woman and she’s like in her mid-thirties and it’s 9:00 p.m. and she’s all dolled up, but it’s like she’s holding her shoes and just stumbling around and vomiting in alleyways, don’t feel sorry for her. She’s just a good mom. [laughter] Found a window of fucking time. [laughter] The Queen of England drinks four cocktails a day. That’s eight standard drinks a day. That means she’s a full-blown fucking alkie. Full-blown. [laughter] My question is, is she a nice drunk or a fucking nasty drunk? Around cocktail three, does she start trawling the palace, just… [laughter] “Philip! [laughter] Philip!” And Philip’s like, “Ah, fuck, Lizzie’s at it again. [laughter] Get my Land Rover ready.” [laughter] She’s just trawling around, “Philip!” [laughter] She goes into one room, she jumps back out with a crown on her head, “Ha-ha! [laughter] I look like the money.” [laughter] I got to tell you a story right now. To tell this story, I have to start off by saying that I’m lactose intolerant. [woman cheers] That means that I will not… tolerate lactose. [laughter] If I eat lactose, 40 minutes later, and you can set your fucking watch by it, [laughter] I will shit myself. [laughter] That sounds like more than just intolerance, doesn’t it? [laughter] I shit myself. [laughter] Like, think about it right now. So, you’re all in groups, right? You’ve probably got groups of three, four friends you’re all hanging out with. And then you have your periphery groups. Like, some cunt in your group has brought some friends from work. Right? And there’s always one cunt in that fucking group where you, like, you turn to one of your good friends and you go, “Can’t tolerate that guy. Can’t tolerate him.” But it’s not like, if he comes near you, [laughter] you shit yourself. [laughter] So, my two biggest nemesisises… Nemesi? -[laughter] -N– The two things that– that I’m not good with… [laughter] are ice cream and cheese. Now, here’s the tragedy that is my life. Ice cream and cheese are also my two favorite things. [laughter] See, I wasn’t always lactose intolerant. No, it happened to me at 35. I’m 42 now. It happened on my 35th birthday. I was sitting down, having my Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake, as I always request. I’m hoeing into it, and then God looked at me and went, “How’s all those atheist jokes going, cunt? -Pew!” [laughter] [cheering and applause] So now I can’t eat ice cream and cheese. Right? But here’s the thing. I still eat ice cream and cheese. [laughter] With the full knowledge that I’m going to shit myself, I still fucking do it. Right? I– I, actually, what I do is if I have a heavy meal, I eat a scoop of ice cream afterwards ’cause then I know I’ll shit everything out, cause… [laughter] I’m a genius, you see? That’s the Jefferies diet. You can fucking take that home with you. [laughter] So, I still eat ice cream and cheese, but I don’t eat them out in the wild. [laughter] You’ll never see me on a boardwalk with an ice cream cone. No, no, no. I eat them at home, amongst people who love me and respect me. Where I know where the toilet is, I know how much toilet paper we’ve got, I’m ready to fucking go. [laughter] So, although I am intolerant of lactose, I still, you could argue, tolerate it. [laughter] In the same way that my dad… doesn’t hate gay people… [laughter] he’s just intolerant of them. [laughter] My father’s a 78-year-old man from rural Australia, and when we were growing up, I heard him say the occasional homophobic slur. When he was young, uh, being gay was a mental illness. He’s a product of his environment. But two years ago, Australia had a referendum, where they voted on gay marriage, and my father voted “yes.” And that’s because I spent time talking to him, going, “Dad, it’s the right thing.” And then my dad said, “Well, I guess they deserve to be as miserable as the rest of us.” [laughter] Now, because my father has done this one forward-thinking thing in his entire life, my dad now thinks he is woke as fuck. [laughter] And my dad says sentences like this. “I’ve got no problems with the gays, they can do whatever they want, in their own homes, behind closed doors, as long as they don’t try to involve me.” [laughter] And I’m always like, “Dad, are they trying to involve you?” [laughter] Is there a scenario… [laughter] …where there’s two gay fellas in the inner suburbs of Sydney, one’s strapped up to a bed with a fucking gag ball in his mouth, the other one’s lubing up his fist, and he’s about to enter, and just as he’s about to go in, this fella goes… [muffled screaming] And he goes, “What’s that, mate?” “Maybe we should try to involve Gary Jefferies.” [laughter] “Oh, that’s a brilliant idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” He unstraps him. They get in their Honda Civic, and they fucking drive. [laughter] It’s a Friday night in Sydney, it’s raining, you’ve got to get around the harbor, it’s fucking– traffic’s horrendous. It takes them an hour 15. They get out to the house where my dad lives. My dad’s just sitting there, watching rugby league. [laughter] He hears a knock on the door. [laughter] [laughter continues] “That’s the second time this month. [laughter] I told you not to involve me.” [laughter] Now, I was, uh, touring in Sydney earlier this year, and I did that routine. My father was in the audience, and he’d brought along all of his bowling friends. My father plays lawn bowls, uh, every day, uh, which is like, uh, curling but with a ball and… You’ll figure it out. Anyway… So he brought these, like, eight mates, and all of his mates were aged between 70 and 90. Right? All these blokes fucking went along. And then my dad came backstage, they’re all sinking piss backstage. My dad comes up to me and goes, “Yeah, I enjoyed the show. Yeah, it was a good show. Good show. Different jokes you’re doing now. Uh… I didn’t like that bit about me and the two gay fellas. I didn’t.” [laughter] And I didn’t understand why, and it turned out the reason he was upset, not because I spoke about him maybe having sex with two men, but because his friends found out that he voted “yes” for gay marriage. [laughter] And now… And now all of his mates take the piss out of him, right? Every time they go to do their shoelaces, they’re like, “Will you marry me, Gary?” [laughter] That’s the thing about my dad, man, he’s trying. At his age, he’s still trying to be progressive and all that type of stuff. And here’s the problem, with young people, right. So… so, he’s backstage, he’s having a few beers, he’s voted yes for gay marriage. Everyone’s teasing him a bit. And then my dad, at 78, says, “Oh, yeah, I’m good with the gays, I like the gays.” And then he goes, “I don’t know about those trans people.” And then a person I know started going, “Well, you’re transphobic. You’re transphobic.” And I was like, “All right, everyone settle the fuck down. [laughter] Settle down.” And I said, “This guy just got used to gay people yesterday. [laughter] Let him have his fucking victory lap. You’re going to scare him off, you cunt.” [laughter] Like, let him be old, you cunt. He goes like this, “Gay people are okay.” And then you go, “Chicks with dicks,” and he’s like, “Fuck off.” [laughter] This is the thing about being progressive and being woke and all that fucking bullshit, right? The-the-the young generations, the millennials, what you’re missing out on is… Let old people be fucking old, right? They’ll be dead soon enough, right? Stop fucking making everyone move as fast as you’re fucking moving, all right? People are trying. Right? Here’s the thing about millennials. You’re the worst people that have ever lived. [laughter] [cheering and applause] You’re the worst. You’re just a horrible breed of people. And I don’t even blame you, it’s just the society you’re in. You have social media. Every single peanut fucking thought that ever came into your head, “I’ll fucking comment…” [laughter] What type of fucking low-rent cunts are you? [laughter] Like… if you take more than three selfies a week, fucking end it. End it. [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right? [cheering and applause continues] The idea that you think taking a photo of yourself, isn’t there something mentally wrong with that? And it’s not just… That’s– That’s bad. That’s bad as it is. But the fact that when you take that photo, your next thought is, “Other people might want to see this.” [laughter] You’re the fucking worst. I… I’ve tried dating you people. It’s a fucking nightmare, right? I don’t care how smooth your fucking skin is, I’ll take an old person with a better fucking attitude, you pricks. [laughter] [cheering and applause] You know, you date a millennial… I used to have nice outings. You used to go to a beach, and you’d watch the sunset. No, fuck that. Sunsets are ruined because you cunts all want to do yoga poses while I stand back here, going, “Did I do a good photo?” [laughter] Heaven forbid I walk past a wall where someone’s painted some fucking wings on, that’s my whole day fucking ruined. [laughter] See, here’s the thing about you. You are… the most progressive generation that’s ever been. That is true. You are the most progressive generation that’s ever been. But here’s something for you. Every generation before you has also been the most progressive generation that’s ever been. You’re not fucking special. [laughter] [woman] Yeah! One day, and you don’t even see it coming, in about 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be the old bigots. [laughter] You don’t see it coming, do you? You’ll be the old bigots. You’ll be standing around with your friends, going, “I don’t understand the kids today. When I was young, women had penises and men had vaginas, and it was all very normal. [laughter] But my grandson says he identifies as an Asian woman who wants to be a black man and marry a fucking robot, and I’m not having it.” [laughter] So my point is… I can’t eat cheese. [laughter] So… [cheering and applause] I can’t. I can’t. It’s not good for me. So… So, I-I went on a date with this girl. I went maybe six or seven dates with her. And I took her out to one of those tasting menu restaurants. You know, those fancy restaurants, Michelin-star thing, where there’s, like, 11 or 12 courses. This is a good move. For any young fella out there who wants to take a girl out, take them to a tasting menu, because if you’re like me, I eat my food too quick, and then I’ve got to sit there and watch them try to, you know… Then I think, “How much of that am I gonna get to eat?” You know? And if you go to a tasting menu, the brilliant thing about going to a fancy restaurant is that the conversation never stops. Because there’s so many courses that you can go, “I liked that course. I didn’t like course number three, but I enjoyed seven, so I wonder what’s up next.” It’s a good way of keeping things going. [laughter] -Now… I tried to do… I tried to do this routine in Kansas. Very hard to explain… [laughter] …what a really good meal’s like. They fucking… They couldn’t wrap their brain around it. I was like, “You know when you go to one of those really fancy restaurants?” [laughter] And I went, “Think about the best meal you’ve ever had.” And then one guy yells out, “Ribs!” And I was like, “Yeah… Yeah, ribs are good. [laughter] But think of a meal that’s even better than ribs.” And he thought about it and he went, “Two ribs!” And I went, “Yeah.” [laughter] So these restaurants… they’re pretentious as fuck, right? Every– Every dish includes a foam, a reduction, and a mousse. And there’s always a quail’s egg and a truffle. Always with a quail’s egg. Why can’t they use a fucking chicken egg? [laughter] Every time I go to the supermarket, I always go to the poultry. I’m never like, “Oh, quail or chicken, what will we eat tonight?” Where the fuck are they buying all the quails’ eggs? [laughter] And come to think of it, I’m not sure… if I’ve ever seen a quail. [laughter] I’ve never been out and gone, “Ah, fuck me, the quails are out tonight. [laughter] Better get the car in the garage, don’t want it covered in quail shit. fucking quails.” So it’s always a reduction, a mousse, and a foam, next to a quail’s egg with a truffle on top. And the first course is always called the amuse-bouche. The amuse-bouche is never on the menu. And what this is in fancy food is you eat that, and that’s meant to make you realize what the rest of the meal might be like. It’s to make you go, “Oh, we’re eating. Oh. [laughter] I get what’s going on. This is a small portion of bigger things.” It’s like if before you came to the show, you all went to a smaller comedy club tonight and watched someone do a five-minute set. So you could go, “I get what Jim’s gonna do.” [laughter] And there’s always some French cunt who’s the waiter. [laughter] I can say this on Netflix, the French are a bunch of cunts. I’m not sure if… [laughter] Are you even watching it? -On your French Netflix? [cheering] [applause] Anyway, so there’s always a French fuck. [laughter] He walks out, and the first course is always served on, like, a ceramic white spoon, with the reduction, the mousse, and the foam, and the quail’s egg, and something on top. And he walks up to you, and he’s very patronizing, and he goes, “Okay, now it’s time for the amuse-bouche.” And then he goes, “The chef has prepared this for you.” And you always… you always nod along, like, “Oh, that’s good, the chef,” when you really should just be an asshole to him and just go, “The chef, you say? [laughter] Did you hear that, honey? The chef’s doing the cooking today. [laughter] I thought the busboy had just fucking stepped it up a gear, but fuck me, I think we’re in for a treat.” [laughter] And then he has the audacity to tell you how to eat it. He goes, “Uh, the chef recommends that you put the spoon in your mouth and you eat it all in one bite, and let the quail’s egg explode over the foam, the mousse, and the reduction, and then you swallow.” “All right.” When you should really go, “Thank fuck you came along, cunt. [laughter] I wouldn’t have known what to do. [laughter] A spoon, you say? A spoon? I would’ve…” [laughter] [chuckles] So then you go through that, then you get a couple more courses. Then there’s always a course that involves something… The ingredients they use aren’t the ingredients that you want to fucking eat, right? If you were to buy a pork product in a supermarket and you were spending money, it would be, like, a pork loin or a chop, right? In these restaurants, it’s always like, “This is the kidney of the thing and the fingernail of the hoof. And… and you are getting the rind from the pig’s eye, the eye socket of the pig.” And you’re like, “Oh, I haven’t got enough socket in my fucking diet.” At the end you’re like, “I’m eating bone marrow, I didn’t know what a bone marrow fan I fucking am.” And it’s all shit. It’s all fucking bad for you. [laughter] I always… I always feel fatter after… This is the deal, right? I’m recording a special right now, so I’ve dropped, like, seven pounds in a week, by just not fucking eating, just not fucking eating, and… I come from a long line of fat people. Right? I come from fat people. The reason I… I lose weight is because of you, the general public, and your comments on the internet. [laughter] Without you and your words of wisdom, I’d be a fat fuck, but thank God you all come along, and you fucking bully the fuck out of me. [laughter] See, I’m not… I’m not for fat shaming, but I kind of am, I kind of am. [laughter] I’m not for any shaming, really, but I don’t know why we’ve gotten to this moment in society where fat people are immune to being shamed, yet every other addiction in our society is shamed. I watched my mother eat herself to death. I fucking watched it. She hid food, she fucking kept on eating, she denied what she was doing, and she fucking died from it, right? I watched it happen. But for some reason, we have to look at fat people and go, “You be your best self, you’re looking great.” Every other fucking addiction in our society, we shame. You smoke a cigarette… You don’t think smokers feel shame? You don’t think smokers are breathing fucking smoke into their lungs, going, “I’m a piece of shit. I’m a parent, what the fuck am I doing with my life?” We don’t need you to go, “You smell. [laughter] You’re killing yourself, go outside. [laughter] There’s a section for people like you.” [laughter] Like fucking cocaine addicts. You don’t think they feel shame? Every time a cocaine addict has a line, they literally have to look at themselves in the fucking mirror. [laughter] You don’t compliment a fucking meth addict who’s picking scabs off their face, like, “You be you. [laughter] You’re living your best life.” No, but eating, we have to watch people get fat as fuck and compliment them? Fuck off. Should be the same as smoking. A fat cunt comes into a doughnut store, the person behind the counter should be able to go, “You’re gonna have to eat that outside.” [laughter] They’ll go outside with their doughnut… Aww. And they’ll have a little roped-off section. Let’s make it small, give them a fucking incentive. [laughter] They can stand out there with the other fatties and look at each other and go, “Oh.” [laughter] “Do you remember when we were allowed to eat on planes?” [laughter] So, anyway, then we go on through the menu, course number five. Now, these fancy restaurants always have a foie gras course. Foie gras, it’s fucking delicious. I didn’t know what it was for years. I just enjoyed it. It’s this buttery, fucking fleshy thing. It’s delicious. And then someone showed me a video. Do you know how they make foie gras? They get a goose, then they step on its fucking feet, and then they pull the goose’s neck up, like this, and they get what’s called a foie gras funnel, which is like a funnel with a big, long tube, and they shove it down the goose’s throat until the goose looks like a fucking sword swallower. [laughter] And then they force-feed the goose grains, day and night, right? And then after that, they wire the goose’s mouth shut so it can’t vomit the food back up. Because of doing this, the goose gets cirrhosis of the liver, and the liver gets fat and yellow, and that’s what gives it that buttery taste. [laughter] My big question is… [laughter] …who was the first cunt to figure that out? [laughter] Who… Who was the first bloke just to walk up to his mates and just go, “Hey, guys… [laughter] I was torturing geese… [laughter] …as I always do… [laughter] …and you would not believe the delicious side effects.” [laughter] Now, I don’t believe in animal cruelty, uh, but– but who here, uh, thinks that we should no longer test on animals? [cheering and applause] All right! They’re what we call fucking idiots. [laughter] If you’re a fucking moron who just applauded, “There should be no animal testing,” you fucking basic cunt. [laughter] Now, I don’t think we should test on animals for something as frivolous as makeup. But when it comes to medicine, what’s our fucking other option? Let’s just think of something really simple, like acne cream. Right? You can’t just get a cucumber… [laughter] …smear the cream on the cucumber and go, “No change to cucumber. [laughter] Ready for people.” [laughter] No, you’ve got to start with a mouse, don’t you? Smear it on the mouse, that mouse dissolves. [laughter] “First cream not good.” [laughter] Then you get another cream. That mouse fucking multiplies like a mogwai hit with water. [laughter] “Better… [laughter] …than first cream. [laughter] Still… not good.” [laughter] Then you get one where it works. Then you go, “That one’s good.” Then you get a rat. Then you get a rabbit. Then you get a cat, then you get a dog, then you get a primate, then you get a homeless person, a student, then us. [laughter] And that’s how we have the medicine. [laughter] So moving on, we go to fucking course number six. The waiter brings up a cart. This thing has a dome on the top. And he rocks up with this fucking thing with the dome. He carried all the other food, but this thing needs a trolley. [laughter] And he pulls it off and there’s all these cheeses there. And he goes, “Your next course is the fromage,” like that. The fro… Actually, I don’t like that. I don’t like that the cunt called it fromage. [laughter] I know it’s a little thing, but it bothers me. He was just doing it to Frenchie the fucking experience up. [laughter] He could’ve said “cheese,” he knows the fucking word’s cheese. Everything else he said in English, and then he had to say fucking fromage. Fuck that cunt. [laughter] You’re telling me… You’re telling me that he’s, uh… he’s learned the entire English language but he’s just one word short? [laughter] I don’t like that. I’ll be honest with you here, and this is being recorded, and I’m happy to say this to the whole world. My most hated group in society… is Italian Americans. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And… And… And… Look, this is a comedy show, so if there are any Italian Americans in the room with us this evening, please know that you’re not welcome. [laughter] [whistling and applause] You’re a fucking painful bunch of people. [laughter] Pick a fucking accent. Either go Italian or go American, but don’t flip-flop. [laughter] You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the waiter will seem normal, and then he’ll fucking change, right? You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the guy will go, “Hey, enjoying your meal? It’s good, right? My mother, she used to make it with the mozzarell…” And you’re like… [laughter] “What the fuck happened to that word, cunt?” You… It’s like he had a fucking stroke in the middle of the fucking word. Mozzarell… Fuck you. [laughter] That’s why I got to give it up for the Asians. I like the Asians. [cheering] They pick an accent, and they fucking stick to it. [laughter] The Asians either go full Asian, or they go full American. They don’t go back and forth. [laughter] You’ll never be in an Asian restaurant and have the waiter walk up and go, “Hey, you enjoyed that? You should try it with some soy-soy.” No, they never do that. [laughter] So kudos, Asians. Kudos. [cheering] Anyway, so he rocks up with his fucking cart of cheese. There’s some soft cheeses there, some Camemberts and Bries and whatnot. The most dangerous cheeses of them all. [laughter] And I look at the cheese. And now, this– this girl, she does not know of my condition. [laughter] And I look at the cheeses, I look up at him, and I went, “How long… [laughter] …is the rest of the meal?” [laughter] And he said, “Uh, maybe, uh, 20 minutes.” I went, “Twenty minutes, I’ve got a 15-minute drive. [laughter] Fromage me.” [laughter] And I got myself a big plate of cheese, and I fucking caned that cunt. I fucking ate all that. We got another couple of courses, they have two dessert courses. One of the courses, the dessert courses, might as well have just been called “lactose.” [laughter] It was a lactose crumble, next to a lactose foam, with a lactose reduction, with a scoop of ice cream, then they freeze-dried some lactose crumble table-side and sprinkled it on top. And I looked at it, and I was like this, “In for a penny, in for a pound.” [laughter] And I ate that bowl of lactose as well. Now, what I didn’t mention is the girl I’m on the date with, she is a very petite girl. She had given up around course six. [laughter] I had also eaten her plate of fromage. [laughter] And her bowl of lactose. [laughter] Lactose is now coursing through my veins. I am on borrowed time. [laughter] And so I’m sitting there, knowing. I’m just sort of like, “All right, we’ll be good here. We’ll be good.” You know? I’m listening to her. “Oh, that’s interesting.” [laughter] And then the waiter comes up and goes, “Would you like a coffee?” And I went, “No! [laughter] Just the check, please.” [laughter] So he gets me the check. Now, we’re gonna go back to my place. Now, I’d been on a few dates with this girl, we’d always gone back to her place. This time was the first night she was gonna come back to my house. I was happy about going back to my place ’cause I know where all the toilets are, I know the distance. There’s a lot of things that were going on there. And because she was staying at my place, she goes to me, she goes, “Oh, we have to stop at the pharmacy… because there’s a-a-a cream that I need, like a lotion type of thing.” And I said, “That you need?” [laughter] And I-I-I said, I said, “Are you sure you don’t want it?” [laughter] And she goes, “No, I… No, I need it.” And I said, “I don’t know if you know the difference between wants and needs. [laughter] Like, if you need it, that means that you’ll die… [laughter] …if you don’t have it. So… Do you need it?” [laughter] And she claimed to need it. So… we drove off to the pharmacy. We get in there, right? We walk in this Rite Aid, and there’s just this wall of fucking lotions and that type of stuff, and I thought she needed it so she would know which one to grab. [laughter] But she’s just sort of looking at them, like this. Right? And I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. -[laughter] -Like this. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And she can’t pick one. Now, this is the thing, she has to get a lotion. I don’t understand what’s going on with the whole lotion thing with women, right? I… Okay, I’ve lived with, uh, six girlfriends in my life. [laughter] In my… In my life, I’ve lived with six women, and all six of them have left me. [laughter] And sooner or later, I’m going to blame myself. [laughter] But not today. [laughter] [cheering and applause] Now… [cheering and applause] Now, every single woman I’ve ever lived with has a nighttime ritual, where they… See, I have a bedtime ritual. What I do is I go to the bathroom, I have a piss, I brush my teeth, I go to bed. [laughter] I’ve recently figured out that I could do them at the same time. [laughter] I have a piss and I brush my teeth, and I spit over, like that… Now, but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for, like, 20 minutes, and you close the door. And then you come out, and the last thing you do is you’re sort of… you’re rubbing something here. [laughter] And then you go like this. [laughter] And then you get into bed, and you tell me what I’ve done wrong that day. [laughter] [applause] And that’s your little nighttime routine. [laughter] Now, I don’t know what goes on in that room. [laughter] But I assume, I can’t be positive, but I assume you are covering your body head to toe in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence. [laughter] Now, I’m 42 years old. Um… I-I wear makeup for work. Like, when I’m on TV, they put makeup on me. I never even wipe it off, I just fucking… They give me a towelette, and I go, “Ah, don’t worry about it.” Then… [laughter] It goes away over a week, and they put it back on. [laughter] Apart from that, I-I’ve worn sunscreen, but I’ve never put anything else on my face. Nothing else my entire life. Um, I’m arguably an alcoholic. [laughter] I… I used to be a heavy smoker. I’ve been a cocaine addict. [cheering] [laughter] And my skin is fucking flawless. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And you want to know why? Because my skin learned at a very young age… [laughter] …that it couldn’t rely on me. [laughter] My skin knew that I was not gonna help it, so it was like, “All right… We’re going to have to produce our own oils if we’re gonna keep shit together.” Where women’s skin… Women’s skin… Every day, women’s skin is like this, “I haven’t had my special cream.” [laughter] And that’s why you all age so horribly. [laughter] [cheering and applause] Yeah, I-I don’t… I don’t do… as many misogynistic jokes as I used to, but I like to whip one in there every now and then. [laughter] It’s funny because I didn’t… I used to do more back in the day. But what happened was, in our society, people started getting angry at me because they didn’t know I was joking. Even though my job description would say… [laughter] …that I was possibly joking. [laughter] So this is what happens now with comedians. For some reason, we’re enemy number one. Every time we do a joke that you don’t like, you all go, “Why did you say that?” “Why…” I get asked at interviews, “Why would you say that joke?” And you go, “I thought it was going to be funny.” [laughter] It’s fucking ridiculous. I’m in trouble now for jokes that I did fucking ten years ago. People ring me up and go, “You said this joke ten years ago.” Now, our job as comedians is, okay, if the line’s here, our job is to go right up to the line, that’s our fucking job. To take risks. To gamble, if you will. Now, what happens when you gamble? You don’t always win. [laughter] Otherwise it wouldn’t be called fucking “gambling.” [laughter] So, what happens is we go all the way up to the line, right, which is fine. So, on my specials, I have jokes that have gotten through standards and practices and lawyers and everything, and still gotten on fucking Netflix, and then you watch it years later, and you’re fucking angry. Well, go fuck yourself, right? Because… [cheering and applause] Because… When I told the joke, the line was here, and it was socially acceptable, right? Now you moved the line back to here, so I won’t go there anymore, I won’t, but the line’s here. But you can’t get angry because you moved the line and then the fucking joke was over here. [laughter and applause] And then… And then you have the audacity to ask me to maybe apologize for a fucking joke. Here’s the thing, I wanted the joke to work. Sometimes you tell a joke and it doesn’t fucking work. And then people go, “Why did you do that?” You go, “I tried to make the joke work, but it didn’t fucking work, and now you’re all upset with me.” [laughter] It’s like if a pilot smashes a plane into fucking the side of a mountain. You don’t go, “Why did you do that?” [laughter] He’ll go, “My intention was to land the plane safely. [laughter] But it turns out I failed at my job. But I didn’t… I didn’t wake up in the morning going, ‘Smash it!'” [laughter] See, it’s like, I watched Dave Chappelle’s special. I watched his special. I thought it was fucking great. [cheering and applause] It was hilarious. And people got upset, and they got upset by different jokes in it. They get… See, here’s the thing. I didn’t enjoy every joke in his special. Some of the things he said, I didn’t even agree with. But you know what happened? When I watched the jokes I didn’t enjoy, I got over it because I’m not a fucking pussy. [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right? And I just listened to the ones I fucking enjoyed. See, he said that he thought that Michael Jackson didn’t fuck kids. Eh. [laughter] I think Michael Jackson did fuck kids. [laughter] That’s how me and Dave differ. [laughter] A lot of people have stopped listening to Michael Jackson’s music. They go, “I won’t listen to it anymore. I won’t listen to it anymore.” I still listen to it. [laughter] But I only listen to the Jackson 5. [laughter] ‘Cause if he was fucking kids back then, it was just experimenting, and there’s nothing wrong with that. [laughter] I go all the way to “Blame It on the Boogie,” and I fucking call it a day. [laughter] So, look… [laughter] What I’m trying to tell you is… she couldn’t pick which cream she wanted. [laughter] And she’s looking at all the different creams. I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. [laughter] And I think to myself, “Fuck it, I’ve got to have a shit.” Now, there’s a bathroom in the back of the, uh, pharmacy, so I duck off. Now, at this point of the story, I got to tell you… all right, that this girl’s a germophobe. It’s vital to the story that she’s a germophobe. Now, we may have some people in the room who identify as germophobes and, to those people… go fuck yourself. [laughter, cheering, and applause] I’ve… I’ve never met a person in my life who’s interesting who’s a fucking germophobe. You’re always boring cunts who tell us all the time that you’re a fucking germophobe. Being a germophobe is doing a lot of heavy lifting for your shit fucking personality. [laughter] How dare you act like we’re all diseased. Every time we shake your hand, you go, “I-I can’t because… eh…” Every time you cook with a germophobe, you cook and put some scraps in the bin, you go, “Hey, can you take that out for the trash for me?” And they’re like, “I’d love to, but I can’t. [laughter] Because I’m a germophobe.” And you’re like, “The rest of us are loving it.” You lick the bin, “Aah.” [laughter] You’re not special. While I’m at it, people with peanut allergies can fuck off an’ all. [laughter, cheering, and applause] Now, I’m not saying that there aren’t people with severe peanut allergies. There truly are. There’s people who will die if they eat a fucking peanut. What I’m saying is it’s your fucking problem. [laughter] The rest of us don’t have to be involved. Right, like, have you ever been on a plane lately, and they go like this, they go, “Uh, on today’s flight, we will not be serving peanuts, as there’s a person on the flight with a severe peanut allergy.” And you’re like, “All right, well, don’t give them to them, then.” [laughter] How fucking weak-willed are these cunts? “Oh, I know it will kill me, but the salty goodness…” [laughter] Like, what do they think the rest of us are going to fucking do? Go to the air stewardess, “Uh, excuse me, uh, who has that peanut allergy?” [laughter] [laughter] What do you think’s gonna happen if someone next to you eats a fucking peanut? Do you think peanut particles will get in the fucking air? Guess what? These flights fly back and forth and back and forth all fucking day. In between, they hardly clean the planes. Do you think they’d go on with a special peanut– de-peanut-ing machine and fucking fill the fucking air? [laughter] See, you know what I do? Every time when I’m on a flight where they serve peanuts, what I do is I get six or seven peanuts, and I wedge them down the back of the fucking seat. [laughter] And if someone ever dies, I’ll be the first person to say, “I was wrong.” [laughter] Now, I talked earlier about, like, how I did one misogynistic joke, and how– how, at the moment now, I-I-I don’t know if people know that I’m fucking joking. It’s become very odd now, this tension that we have about what’s right and what’s wrong. I was on a plane and this fucking… This woman was trying to put a bag in the overhead luggage, and she was shaking, and she can’t do it. And I went to help her, and she just looked at me and went, “No, no,” like that. [laughter] And it’s, like, now I’m in trouble for trying to do a nice thing. That used to be my one move. [laughter] I used to open doors, I used to lift bags, I used to stand up for pregnant people on buses. That was my fucking gig. That’s what I had going. -[laughter] And now, because I tried to help her, she’s, like… She’s, like, angry at me? Like I’m trying to do a male patriarchy thing, where I can lift this better than you. So I just told her to fuck off. [laughter] And… turns out, she’s just a woman with Parkinson’s, and she did need my help. [laughter] But that scenario could’ve been different is what I’m saying. [laughter] Like, I was in a movie… I was in a movie with my son. We were watching… A couple of years ago, we were watching the Ghostbusters movie, the new one with the female cast. Watching Ghostbusters. My son, he’s four at the time, and he turns to me watching Ghostbusters, and he goes, “This movie’s not as good as the other Ghostbusters.” And I went, “Shut up, shh. [laughter] You’re not allowed to say that. This movie’s every bit as good as the other Ghostbusters. We’ll talk about it in the car.” [laughter] You know, and on reflection, that movie wasn’t as good. [laughter] It was a shit fucking movie. [laughter] Wasn’t funny, the action sequences weren’t good, it was a fucking shit film. It wasn’t shit because women were in it. It was just shit because it was shit. [laughter] You know what I mean? Like, ’cause that cast… Paul Feig is the director. He directed Bridesmaids, one of my top ten comedies. The rest of the cast was from that movie, they’d made good films together. This one was just a misfire. But the weird thing that happened was no one went to see that film, and then all of a sudden, men were pigs, men are fucking misogynistic assholes because that film didn’t do good. No. It didn’t do good because you women didn’t fucking see it either. If you went and saw the movie… If you went and saw the movie, it would have been a success. But you didn’t fucking see it, then you got angry at us for not fucking seeing it. [laughter] Do you want to know why it didn’t do well? It’s an action comedy, and if you go to any marketing company that talks about how they sell things, action comedies primarily are enjoyed by men. There might be exceptions to the rule, but primarily men like action comedies. Do you want to know why? Because we’re funny, and we do things, and… [laughter] And… And women like dramas because you cause drama. [laughter] [cheering and applause] So my point is… stop remaking our fucking movies. Leave our movies alone. We don’t remake your films. You don’t see Brad Pitt and George Clooney getting together to make Mystic fucking Pizza of the Sisterhood of the Ya-Ya Fuckhead Traveling Pants Movie. [laughter] We leave your shit alone. [laughter] Although there should be some films that should be remade with, you know, different casts. Like, one of my favorite movies from my childhood was, uh, Nine to Five. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda. Fantastic. It still stands up today. It’s about three women, they have a boss who’s a fucking pig. Like, it’s even poignant right now. They have a boss who’s a pig. So what they do is they drug him, and they put him in bondage gear, and they hang him from the roof of one of their garages for three weeks. It’s a fun film. [laughter] You know, they should do that with a male cast, right? So, there’s a woman, you put her in the position of power. [laughter] The three employees don’t like it, so they drug her, and they put her in bondage gear, and they hang her from the roof of one of their garages. It’s just a fun film. [laughter] Another movie that needs an opposite remake: Brokeback Mountain. [laughter] [cheering and applause] That movie’s… It needs it! [laughter] The original film is a couple of blokes, they’re working on the land, they ran out of conversation. So they went into a tent, and they fucked each other in the ass. [laughter] My film, it’s a couple of young lasses, they’re working on the land, they’re doing a man’s job. They get bored, so they go into a tent, and they finger-bang each other. [laughter] [laughter] My version doesn’t even need a tent. [laughter] But one of the things that’s happening in cinema at the moment is, and I think we can all agree on this… Okay, so… So we’re done with blackface people. Stop doing that. People don’t like it. If-If you’re getting ready for Halloween and you think, “I might do blackface,” just don’t. [laughter] It’s so much easier to not do blackface. [laughter] Like you don’t have to do anything. Just save yourself time. See, the thing is, with actors now you’ve got in movies… I think we’ve all agreed that you can’t play outside your race. It goes back to, like, Mickey Rooney playing an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Don’t play outside your race. You can only play your race. I think we can all agree on that now. Now, there’s another thing happening now, where the gays are getting upset if heterosexuals are playing gay people on film. I’m not sure about that, but I’m open to discussion. But here’s the thing that’s really fucking pissing me off. Taron Edgerton, or Egerton, or whatever, he played Elton John and Eddie the Eagle. Two of the ugliest cunts that have ever lived. [laughter] He’s really good-looking. I don’t fucking like that. [laughter] He’s playing uglyface. How many ugly actors would like that fucking opportunity? [yelling] Do the good-looking people need fucking everything? [laughter] Like, Charlize Theron fucking gains 30 pounds, and all they say is, “How brave.” [laughter] You know what’s brave? Being ugly every single fucking day. [cheering and applause] So I decide to go off to the toilet, right? And I’m going off… [laughter] And she goes, “Where are you going?” And there’s no point lying anymore, so I just went like this, “Um… I have to shit myself.” [laughter] And she goes, “If you take a shit in a public toilet, then I’ll never fuck you again.” I was like, [exhales] [laughter] “It’s a very good argument. That’s a… That’s what you call a quandary.” [laughter] So, I went, “All right, but just fucking hurry up.” So now I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” jog. I’m like, “Come on. [laughter] Pick a fucking cream. Pick a cream, any cream. They’re all good. All of these creams are good.” She’s not hurrying up, so I did what every man has done in a relationship. Right? And there’s a few men in this room that probably did it this evening to get here on time. This is how you hurry up your wife or your girlfriend. Every man does this. This is our special move. We go out… and we sit in the car. [laughter] And we think, “This’ll send a strong message.” [laughter] Now, I assume women are like, “Ah, thank fuck he’s gone to sit in the car.” [laughter] So, I’m sitting in the car and I do this move, where I’ve leant like this, I leant all the way down, and I’m trying to breathe through it, like I’m in, like, a Lamaze class, like… [exhales] [exhales] And the reason I’m sitting like this is because my theory is if I lay flat like this, the shit won’t come out as quickly -because of gravity, you see? [laughter] If I sit upright, the shit has an easier way to fall. [man] Yeah! And also, sitting like this, I’m clenching my ass cheeks together. [laughter] Because if the shit gets past the sphincter, it won’t get past the impenetrable barrier that is me clenching my ass cheeks together. Because I’m a fucking genius. [laughter] And I’m sitting there, and I’m watching her through the window of the pharmacy. [laughter] And she selects the cream, but then she stops a bit. Right? Then she goes back to get another cream. So I’ve got to hurry this up, so I start honking, just… Honk! Honk! She looks out like she’s really angry with me. Then she’s going to the counter. I think, “Oh, good, she’s coming.” Then she just, like, bumps into a friend. [laughter] Starts fucking talking to someone. So, I thought, “I’d better step this up a gear.” So, I put the window down, and I lean my head out the window, and every time the sliding doors open like this… [laughter] …I went, “I’m gonna shit myself! [laughter] I’m gonna shit myself!” [laughter] Now… I forget that I’m off the telly. I don’t think about it on a regular basis, right? So, I’m leaning out the window, yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself,” and this 14-year-old kid skateboards by and goes, “Good luck with that, Jim.” [laughter] [applause] So I’m sitting there yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself.” Eventually she comes out, she gets in the car, and, like, obviously she’s upset. She has reason. I have been yelling, “I’m going to shit myself,” and honking the horn. [laughter] She sits next to me and she goes, “I cannot believe…” And I went, “No time to fight! [laughter] This is not a drill.” [laughter] And I fucking fishtail out of the fucking car park. Now I’m in Ventura, and I’m whizzing through traffic. She’s holding on, fucking… The cream’s bouncing around. I see the Golden Arches, I see McDonald’s. I turned to her, I said, “Could I please have a shit in the McDonald’s? [laughter] McDonald’s are renowned for how clean they keep their toilets. I won’t even sit on the seat. I’ll just hover and spray.” [laughter] To that, I received a firm, “No.” [laughter] So I have to make a decision. My house is five minutes away. Her house is three minutes away. I-I make a call. I’ve got to go to her house, it’s the only way I’ll make it, right? Now, this… This kills me. Every day I think about this, right? If I went to her house to begin with, I never would’ve had to stop to get the cream. [laughter] So, anyway, we get into her house… we get in the driveway, she has a long driveway. I park the car. I get out. I’m already like this, “Come on!” “Come on!” [laughter] She’s got the keys, so none of my running’s helping. She’s just fucking in heels, just going through her bag. I’m going, “Come on!” Now she’s stopped being angry, she just finds this hilarious. [laughter] She’s just laughing. We get to the door. Right, now, you know when you’ve really… you’ve… you really have needed to do a shit? It could be five minutes, it could be five hours, but there was an amount of time where you were desperate to do a shit. Then you get to within 12 feet of the toilet. [laughter] And your asshole starts to reward itself… [laughter] for all the good work that you’ve put in. [laughter] Your asshole goes, “Yeah, we did it! [laughter] We did it! We did it as a team! And that’s my favorite thing: that we did it together!” [laughter] ‘Cause you always get to the toilet, you always go… “Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!” Pooooooof! [laughter and applause] You never go… seat… Poof! No. Why is it that you always just made it? You’re not that lucky. There aren’t that many coincidences in the world… [laughter] …that you always just made it. It’s that your asshole has its own brain and a, like, Pavlovian response. So anyway… I get up to the door, and I’m going, “Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!” And I’m, like, really yelling. She walks up, she gets the keys out, she’s laughing. She goes to put the keys in the door, she drops the keys. -[laughter] -[woman] Oh! The keys hit the ground, and I shit myself. [laughter] [applause] And this isn’t just like a little warning squirt of, like, “All right, there’s more where this came from.” And it wasn’t like a full evacuation either. It wasn’t just like a full… “Pooof” like this. It was the weirdest thing. It was just shit coming out of me in a steady meter, just… [laughter] No pushing. [laughter] No pushing. Everything from liquids to solids and everything in between. [laughter] And I’d gone from being all “Aaagh!” to just a calmness… [laughter] …came over me. I was just… [laughter] And my jeans are filling up. [laughter] And instantly, the… the smell of human fecal matter has filled the air. And for the first time, she gets her ass into gear and she goes, “Oh, fuck!” And she grabs the keys… [laughter] And I went, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [laughter] No point hurrying anymore. [laughter] You take your time.” [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right. Now, before I go, I’m gonna tell a very, very quick little story. Um… My mother passed away a few months ago, and, um, when my mother died… Look, my mother, uh was never… Yeah, look, here’s the deal. My mother’s not a– wasn’t a funny woman. She had no… no sense of humor, never found me funny. She never watched anything that I did and went, “That was funny.” But she was always… [laughter] She was always very supportive of me. And, you know, the only per… she was the only one in my life, the only one, that I bagged on my mother so much, I called her Gunta, she was the butt of so many fucking jokes that I said. And I’ll give her this, she never complained, not fucking once. Not once. [cheering and applause] So… I’d like to tell one story where she comes out of it a little bit cooler. Right? Now, when I was about 13 and my brother was about 17, we were home watching, uh, Star Wars. Right? We were home watching Star Wars. I was on the Throne of Misery, my brother was on the couch, watching Star Wars. My brother Scott, who’s a fucking nutjob, right, he turns to me and he goes, “Hey, Jim, get me a Coke.” And I went, “Get your own fucking Coke, I’m not gonna get you a Coke.” And he goes, “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” [laughter] “What? What?” [laughter] “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” I go, “I’m not getting you a fucking Coke.” And he’s going, “So you’d rather I just pissed on the carpet?” I go, “I guess that’s what I’m fucking telling you.” [laughter] And my brother walks to the middle of the living room, stands in front of me, gets out his cock, starts pissing on the carpet, and he looks at me and he goes, “I don’t know why you constantly find the need to cause trouble. [laughter] It would have been so easy for you just to get a Coke, but, no, not Jim, has to be difficult.” Then he shakes his cock, puts it away, goes back, lies down. Now, this is the bit that fucking kills me. [laughter] He doesn’t get a Coke. [laughter] So, I was sitting there, you know, 40 degrees Celsius, no air conditioning, fucking… a puddle of urine in the middle of the living room, just steaming upwards. Now we’re onto about… We’re probably on Return of the Jedi by now. My mom comes in, and she does that thing that parents do when they have no words. She walks in, just to see the urine in the middle, and she went like this, “Why? [laughter] Who… Who would… Who would… Why?” [laughter] And then she went, “Every fucking day it’s something different. Every day.” [laughter] And then she went, “Who did this?” And I didn’t want to get in trouble, so I went, “Scott did it.” And she turned to Scott and she goes, “What did you do that for?” And he went, “I told Jim to get me a Coke, or I’d piss on the carpet.” [laughter] And my mother turns to me and goes… [imitates hard slap] [laughter] “Why didn’t you get him a Coke? You know he’s fucking mental.” [laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. [cheering and applause] Good night. I appreciate it, I really do.

        From Life Is Worth Losing\\nRecorded on November 5, 2005, Beacon Theater, New York City, New York “It’s called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it”.  People are fucking nuts. This country is full of nitwits and assholes. Do you ever notice that? Oh, my goodness, yes. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Nitwits, assholes, fuck ups, scumbags, jerk offs and dipshits. And they all vote. They all vote, yeah. In fact, sometimes you get the impression They’re the only ones who vote. You can usually tell who’s been doing the voting by looking at the fucking election returns. Man, it sure ain’t me out there wasting my time with a meaningless activity like that. You know those people on the “Jerry Springer Show”, those are the average Americans. Oh, yeah, believe me. Below average can’t get on the show. Can’t get on. Below average is sitting home watching that shit on TV, getting ready to out and vote, filling out their sample ballot. People are fucking dumb. You can say what you want about this country, and I love this place. I love the freedoms we used to have. I love it. I love that. I love it when it didn’t take a fucking catastrophe to get us to care for one another. I love the fact that we’re on camera all the time from all angles. But, you know, you can say what you want about America. And I say I love this place. I wouldn’t have it any other way, wouldn’t live in any other time in history in any other place. But say what you want about America. Land of the free, home of the brave. We’ve got some dumb-ass motherfuckers floating around this country. Dumb-ass motherfuckers, you know. Now, obviously that doesn’t include this audience. I understand that. You seem intelligent and perceptive but the rest of them, holy jumping fucking shit balls. Dumber than a second coat of paint. Now, this ain’t just ranting and raving. This ain’t just blowing off steam. I got a little evidence to support my claim. It just seems to me seems to me, that only a really low IQ population could have taken this beautiful continent, this magnificent American landscape that we inherited… Well, actually, we stole it from the Mexicans and the Indians but. Hey, it was nice when we stole it. It looked pretty good. It was pristine. Paradise. Have you seen it lately? Have you taken a good look at it lately? It’s fucking embarrassing. Only a nation of unenlightened half-wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today, a shopping mall. A big, fucking shopping mall. You know that. That’s all you got. That’s all you got here, folks. Mile after mile of mall after mall. Many, many malls. Major malls and mini malls. They put the mini malls in between the major malls. And in between the mini malls they put the mini marts. And in between the mini marts. You’ve got the car lots, gas stations, muffler shops, Laundromats, cheap hotels, fast food joints, strip clubs and dirty bookstores. America the beautiful. One big transcontinental commercial cesspool. And how do the people feel about all this? How do the people feel about living in a coast-to-coast shopping mall? Well, they think it’s JUST FUCKING DANDY! They think it is as cool as can be. Because Americans love the mall. They love the mall. That’s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time. Shopping and eating. Millions of semiconscious Americans day after day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating. Especially eating. Americans love to eat. They are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food. Hot dogs, corn dogs, triple bacon cheeseburgers, deep-fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheesewhiz, mayonnaise-soaked barbecue, mozzarella patty melts. America will eat anything. Anything. Anything. Shit,if you were selling sautéed raccoons assholes on a stick, Americans would buy them and eat them. Especially if you dipped them in butter and put a little salsa on them. This country is big-time pig time. Forget the bald eagle. You know what the national emblem of this country ought to be? A big bowl of macaroni and cheese. A BIG BOWL. Because everything in this country is king size. King size, extra large and SUPER JUMBO. Especially the fucking people! Have you seen some of the people in this country? Have you taken a good look at some of these big, fat motherfuckers walking around? Big, fat motherfuckers. Oh, my God. Huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of interstate buses. The people in this country are immense. Massive bellies. Monstrous thighs and big, fat fucking asses. And if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them, you’ll look at one of them and you begin to wonder, How does this woman take a shit? How does she shit? And even more frightening, How does she wipe her ass? Can she even locate her asshole? She must require assistance. Are paramedics trained in this field? And standing right next to her. Of course. With a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of pie is her clueless fucking husband Joe Six Pack. With his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckle. This guy ain’t seen his dick since the Nixon administration. And if you stand there and you look at the two of them. You begin to wonder to yourself, Do these people fuck? Is this man actually capable of fucking this woman? It doesn’t seem structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration. Maybe they’re in that “Cirque du Soleil” or something. I’m telling you the people in this country – every one of them – is 50 pounds overweight. They are GARGANTUAN. And in the summertime – God help us – in the summertime they will all want to wear short pants. Jesus Lord, Protector of All That is Good and Holy, deliver us from fat people in short pants. They all got short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Short pants, big bellies, fat thighs and dumb kids. Every one of them has got two dumbass kids with them. And the whole family is wearing T-shirts, and every one of them has got the same T-shirt… “I’m with stupid.” Apparently in this country, the Stupids are an extended family. And besides wearing them T-shirts. Everyone in the family has got on a backpack. They got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid shit. And the reason they got to carry their stupid shit strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold food. And to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting shit they ate that day. And… Another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid shit. They ain’t got enough stupid shit at home. They just had a stupid shit sale, they’re gonna buy more. They’re going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big, fat, ugly, oversized SUV that’s got plenty of room in it. Plenty of room in it for stupid shit and lots of room left over for these big, fat, ugly motherfuckers to get them home. Stopping on the way, of course, for jelly roll and fried dough. These people, these people are efficient, professional, compulsive consumers. It’s their civic duty. Consumption. It’s the new national pastime. Fuck baseball. It’s consumption. The only true lasting American value that’s left. Buying things. Buying things. People spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need. MONEY THEY DON’T HAVE ON THINGS THEY DON’T NEED. So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18 percent interest on something that cost 12.50. And they didn’t like it when they got it home anyway! Not too bright, folks. Not too fucking bright. But if you talk to one of them about this. If you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally, and you talk to them about the low IQ’s and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions. Right away they start talking about education. That’s the big answer to everything. Education. They say “We need more money for education. We need more books. More teachers. More classrooms. More schools. We need more testing for the kids”. You say to them, “Well, you know, we’ve tried all of that and the kids still can’t pass the tests”. They say, “Don’t you worry about that. We’re going to lower the passing grades”. And that’s what they do in a lot of these schools now. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass. More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody’s happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a fucking pencil. Got a pencil? Get the fuck in there, it’s physics. Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do. “EDUCAATION”. Politicians know that word. They USE it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things, the flag, the Bible and children. “No child left behind. No child left behind.” Oh, really? Well, it wasn’t long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start. Head start. Left behind. Someone is losing fucking ground here. But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. There’s a reason that education sucks. And it’s the same reason that it will never ever. Ever be fixed. It’s never going to get any better. Don’t look for it. Be happy with what you got. BECAUSE THE OWNERS OF THIS COUNTRY DON’T WANT THAT. I’m talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians… they’re irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. YOU DON’T. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. YOU HAVE OWNERS. THEY OWN YOU. THEY OWN *EVERYTHING*! They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls. They got the judges in their back pocket. And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear! THEY’VE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS! They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed. Well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interest. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want OBEDIENT WORKERS. OBEDIENT WORKERS. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits. The end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now, they’re coming for your SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back! So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street! And you know something, they’ll get it… they’ll get it ALL from you sooner or later… because they own this fucking place! It’s a BIG CLUB…AND YOU AIN’T IN IT! You and I are not in the big club! By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head. And their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy… The table is tilted. Folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good. Honest. Hard- working people. White collar. Blue collar. It doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good, honest, hard-working people continue… these are people of modest means. Continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them. THEY DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU. AT ALL. AT ALL. AT ALL! Yeah. You know. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth… It’s called the American dream. Because you have to be asleep to believe it. Your email address will not be published.

       "gervais    Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes. Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go, “Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete, he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took 45 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would! I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long. Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes, but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28, proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t… burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context, it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said, “Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went, “Fucking brilliant, mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went, “Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night! Prolefeed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [rock music plays] [cheering and applause] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Jefferies! [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause continues] Hello, Boston! How you doing? Thank you for that. Thank you for that. You all getting fucked up? [cheering] I’m not drinking. I got water. -I can’t drink like I used to drink. Okay? [audience] Aww. I used to drink– I used to be a daily drinker. I used to be five drinks, every day, seven days a week, which is 35 drinks a week. Which the FDA of America says that means I’m an alcoholic. They say anything over 20 drinks makes you an alcoholic. Bullshit. [laughter] That’s less than three drinks a fucking day. That’s a reasonable amount of fucking drinking. You can have three drinks a day. There’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t have a problem. [laughter] Two lines of coke a day isn’t a coke problem. [laughter] It isn’t a coke problem. That’s less than a gram a week. [laughter] You know why I stopped drinking so much is because I cracked open a beer, and my son, he was five at the time, he looked up at me, he went, “Daddy, are you drinking again?” [laughter] I’m like, “Where the fuck did that come from, you little…?” [laughter] Like, very clearly it was from the woman who I gave a house to, but I was like… [laughter] So, I don’t… I don’t drink… I don’t drink like that anymore. I don’t drink, ’cause I’m a good dad, you know? So, what I do now is I just drink one day a week, but I still get my 35 in. [laughter] That’s how society has pushed me. [cheering and applause] That’s why if you ever see, like, a woman and she’s like in her mid-thirties and it’s 9:00 p.m. and she’s all dolled up, but it’s like she’s holding her shoes and just stumbling around and vomiting in alleyways, don’t feel sorry for her. She’s just a good mom. [laughter] Found a window of fucking time. [laughter] The Queen of England drinks four cocktails a day. That’s eight standard drinks a day. That means she’s a full-blown fucking alkie. Full-blown. [laughter] My question is, is she a nice drunk or a fucking nasty drunk? Around cocktail three, does she start trawling the palace, just… [laughter] “Philip! [laughter] Philip!” And Philip’s like, “Ah, fuck, Lizzie’s at it again. [laughter] Get my Land Rover ready.” [laughter] She’s just trawling around, “Philip!” [laughter] She goes into one room, she jumps back out with a crown on her head, “Ha-ha! [laughter] I look like the money.” [laughter] I got to tell you a story right now. To tell this story, I have to start off by saying that I’m lactose intolerant. [woman cheers] That means that I will not… tolerate lactose. [laughter] If I eat lactose, 40 minutes later, and you can set your fucking watch by it, [laughter] I will shit myself. [laughter] That sounds like more than just intolerance, doesn’t it? [laughter] I shit myself. [laughter] Like, think about it right now. So, you’re all in groups, right? You’ve probably got groups of three, four friends you’re all hanging out with. And then you have your periphery groups. Like, some cunt in your group has brought some friends from work. Right? And there’s always one cunt in that fucking group where you, like, you turn to one of your good friends and you go, “Can’t tolerate that guy. Can’t tolerate him.” But it’s not like, if he comes near you, [laughter] you shit yourself. [laughter] So, my two biggest nemesisises… Nemesi? -[laughter] -N– The two things that– that I’m not good with… [laughter] are ice cream and cheese. Now, here’s the tragedy that is my life. Ice cream and cheese are also my two favorite things. [laughter] See, I wasn’t always lactose intolerant. No, it happened to me at 35. I’m 42 now. It happened on my 35th birthday. I was sitting down, having my Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake, as I always request. I’m hoeing into it, and then God looked at me and went, “How’s all those atheist jokes going, cunt? -Pew!” [laughter] [cheering and applause] So now I can’t eat ice cream and cheese. Right? But here’s the thing. I still eat ice cream and cheese. [laughter] With the full knowledge that I’m going to shit myself, I still fucking do it. Right? I– I, actually, what I do is if I have a heavy meal, I eat a scoop of ice cream afterwards ’cause then I know I’ll shit everything out, cause… [laughter] I’m a genius, you see? That’s the Jefferies diet. You can fucking take that home with you. [laughter] So, I still eat ice cream and cheese, but I don’t eat them out in the wild. [laughter] You’ll never see me on a boardwalk with an ice cream cone. No, no, no. I eat them at home, amongst people who love me and respect me. Where I know where the toilet is, I know how much toilet paper we’ve got, I’m ready to fucking go. [laughter] So, although I am intolerant of lactose, I still, you could argue, tolerate it. [laughter] In the same way that my dad… doesn’t hate gay people… [laughter] he’s just intolerant of them. [laughter] My father’s a 78-year-old man from rural Australia, and when we were growing up, I heard him say the occasional homophobic slur. When he was young, uh, being gay was a mental illness. He’s a product of his environment. But two years ago, Australia had a referendum, where they voted on gay marriage, and my father voted “yes.” And that’s because I spent time talking to him, going, “Dad, it’s the right thing.” And then my dad said, “Well, I guess they deserve to be as miserable as the rest of us.” [laughter] Now, because my father has done this one forward-thinking thing in his entire life, my dad now thinks he is woke as fuck. [laughter] And my dad says sentences like this. “I’ve got no problems with the gays, they can do whatever they want, in their own homes, behind closed doors, as long as they don’t try to involve me.” [laughter] And I’m always like, “Dad, are they trying to involve you?” [laughter] Is there a scenario… [laughter] …where there’s two gay fellas in the inner suburbs of Sydney, one’s strapped up to a bed with a fucking gag ball in his mouth, the other one’s lubing up his fist, and he’s about to enter, and just as he’s about to go in, this fella goes… [muffled screaming] And he goes, “What’s that, mate?” “Maybe we should try to involve Gary Jefferies.” [laughter] “Oh, that’s a brilliant idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” He unstraps him. They get in their Honda Civic, and they fucking drive. [laughter] It’s a Friday night in Sydney, it’s raining, you’ve got to get around the harbor, it’s fucking– traffic’s horrendous. It takes them an hour 15. They get out to the house where my dad lives. My dad’s just sitting there, watching rugby league. [laughter] He hears a knock on the door. [laughter] [laughter continues] “That’s the second time this month. [laughter] I told you not to involve me.” [laughter] Now, I was, uh, touring in Sydney earlier this year, and I did that routine. My father was in the audience, and he’d brought along all of his bowling friends. My father plays lawn bowls, uh, every day, uh, which is like, uh, curling but with a ball and… You’ll figure it out. Anyway… So he brought these, like, eight mates, and all of his mates were aged between 70 and 90. Right? All these blokes fucking went along. And then my dad came backstage, they’re all sinking piss backstage. My dad comes up to me and goes, “Yeah, I enjoyed the show. Yeah, it was a good show. Good show. Different jokes you’re doing now. Uh… I didn’t like that bit about me and the two gay fellas. I didn’t.” [laughter] And I didn’t understand why, and it turned out the reason he was upset, not because I spoke about him maybe having sex with two men, but because his friends found out that he voted “yes” for gay marriage. [laughter] And now… And now all of his mates take the piss out of him, right? Every time they go to do their shoelaces, they’re like, “Will you marry me, Gary?” [laughter] That’s the thing about my dad, man, he’s trying. At his age, he’s still trying to be progressive and all that type of stuff. And here’s the problem, with young people, right. So… so, he’s backstage, he’s having a few beers, he’s voted yes for gay marriage. Everyone’s teasing him a bit. And then my dad, at 78, says, “Oh, yeah, I’m good with the gays, I like the gays.” And then he goes, “I don’t know about those trans people.” And then a person I know started going, “Well, you’re transphobic. You’re transphobic.” And I was like, “All right, everyone settle the fuck down. [laughter] Settle down.” And I said, “This guy just got used to gay people yesterday. [laughter] Let him have his fucking victory lap. You’re going to scare him off, you cunt.” [laughter] Like, let him be old, you cunt. He goes like this, “Gay people are okay.” And then you go, “Chicks with dicks,” and he’s like, “Fuck off.” [laughter] This is the thing about being progressive and being woke and all that fucking bullshit, right? The-the-the young generations, the millennials, what you’re missing out on is… Let old people be fucking old, right? They’ll be dead soon enough, right? Stop fucking making everyone move as fast as you’re fucking moving, all right? People are trying. Right? Here’s the thing about millennials. You’re the worst people that have ever lived. [laughter] [cheering and applause] You’re the worst. You’re just a horrible breed of people. And I don’t even blame you, it’s just the society you’re in. You have social media. Every single peanut fucking thought that ever came into your head, “I’ll fucking comment…” [laughter] What type of fucking low-rent cunts are you? [laughter] Like… if you take more than three selfies a week, fucking end it. End it. [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right? [cheering and applause continues] The idea that you think taking a photo of yourself, isn’t there something mentally wrong with that? And it’s not just… That’s– That’s bad. That’s bad as it is. But the fact that when you take that photo, your next thought is, “Other people might want to see this.” [laughter] You’re the fucking worst. I… I’ve tried dating you people. It’s a fucking nightmare, right? I don’t care how smooth your fucking skin is, I’ll take an old person with a better fucking attitude, you pricks. [laughter] [cheering and applause] You know, you date a millennial… I used to have nice outings. You used to go to a beach, and you’d watch the sunset. No, fuck that. Sunsets are ruined because you cunts all want to do yoga poses while I stand back here, going, “Did I do a good photo?” [laughter] Heaven forbid I walk past a wall where someone’s painted some fucking wings on, that’s my whole day fucking ruined. [laughter] See, here’s the thing about you. You are… the most progressive generation that’s ever been. That is true. You are the most progressive generation that’s ever been. But here’s something for you. Every generation before you has also been the most progressive generation that’s ever been. You’re not fucking special. [laughter] [woman] Yeah! One day, and you don’t even see it coming, in about 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be the old bigots. [laughter] You don’t see it coming, do you? You’ll be the old bigots. You’ll be standing around with your friends, going, “I don’t understand the kids today. When I was young, women had penises and men had vaginas, and it was all very normal. [laughter] But my grandson says he identifies as an Asian woman who wants to be a black man and marry a fucking robot, and I’m not having it.” [laughter] So my point is… I can’t eat cheese. [laughter] So… [cheering and applause] I can’t. I can’t. It’s not good for me. So… So, I-I went on a date with this girl. I went maybe six or seven dates with her. And I took her out to one of those tasting menu restaurants. You know, those fancy restaurants, Michelin-star thing, where there’s, like, 11 or 12 courses. This is a good move. For any young fella out there who wants to take a girl out, take them to a tasting menu, because if you’re like me, I eat my food too quick, and then I’ve got to sit there and watch them try to, you know… Then I think, “How much of that am I gonna get to eat?” You know? And if you go to a tasting menu, the brilliant thing about going to a fancy restaurant is that the conversation never stops. Because there’s so many courses that you can go, “I liked that course. I didn’t like course number three, but I enjoyed seven, so I wonder what’s up next.” It’s a good way of keeping things going. [laughter] -Now… I tried to do… I tried to do this routine in Kansas. Very hard to explain… [laughter] …what a really good meal’s like. They fucking… They couldn’t wrap their brain around it. I was like, “You know when you go to one of those really fancy restaurants?” [laughter] And I went, “Think about the best meal you’ve ever had.” And then one guy yells out, “Ribs!” And I was like, “Yeah… Yeah, ribs are good. [laughter] But think of a meal that’s even better than ribs.” And he thought about it and he went, “Two ribs!” And I went, “Yeah.” [laughter] So these restaurants… they’re pretentious as fuck, right? Every– Every dish includes a foam, a reduction, and a mousse. And there’s always a quail’s egg and a truffle. Always with a quail’s egg. Why can’t they use a fucking chicken egg? [laughter] Every time I go to the supermarket, I always go to the poultry. I’m never like, “Oh, quail or chicken, what will we eat tonight?” Where the fuck are they buying all the quails’ eggs? [laughter] And come to think of it, I’m not sure… if I’ve ever seen a quail. [laughter] I’ve never been out and gone, “Ah, fuck me, the quails are out tonight. [laughter] Better get the car in the garage, don’t want it covered in quail shit. fucking quails.” So it’s always a reduction, a mousse, and a foam, next to a quail’s egg with a truffle on top. And the first course is always called the amuse-bouche. The amuse-bouche is never on the menu. And what this is in fancy food is you eat that, and that’s meant to make you realize what the rest of the meal might be like. It’s to make you go, “Oh, we’re eating. Oh. [laughter] I get what’s going on. This is a small portion of bigger things.” It’s like if before you came to the show, you all went to a smaller comedy club tonight and watched someone do a five-minute set. So you could go, “I get what Jim’s gonna do.” [laughter] And there’s always some French cunt who’s the waiter. [laughter] I can say this on Netflix, the French are a bunch of cunts. I’m not sure if… [laughter] Are you even watching it? -On your French Netflix? [cheering] [applause] Anyway, so there’s always a French fuck. [laughter] He walks out, and the first course is always served on, like, a ceramic white spoon, with the reduction, the mousse, and the foam, and the quail’s egg, and something on top. And he walks up to you, and he’s very patronizing, and he goes, “Okay, now it’s time for the amuse-bouche.” And then he goes, “The chef has prepared this for you.” And you always… you always nod along, like, “Oh, that’s good, the chef,” when you really should just be an asshole to him and just go, “The chef, you say? [laughter] Did you hear that, honey? The chef’s doing the cooking today. [laughter] I thought the busboy had just fucking stepped it up a gear, but fuck me, I think we’re in for a treat.” [laughter] And then he has the audacity to tell you how to eat it. He goes, “Uh, the chef recommends that you put the spoon in your mouth and you eat it all in one bite, and let the quail’s egg explode over the foam, the mousse, and the reduction, and then you swallow.” “All right.” When you should really go, “Thank fuck you came along, cunt. [laughter] I wouldn’t have known what to do. [laughter] A spoon, you say? A spoon? I would’ve…” [laughter] [chuckles] So then you go through that, then you get a couple more courses. Then there’s always a course that involves something… The ingredients they use aren’t the ingredients that you want to fucking eat, right? If you were to buy a pork product in a supermarket and you were spending money, it would be, like, a pork loin or a chop, right? In these restaurants, it’s always like, “This is the kidney of the thing and the fingernail of the hoof. And… and you are getting the rind from the pig’s eye, the eye socket of the pig.” And you’re like, “Oh, I haven’t got enough socket in my fucking diet.” At the end you’re like, “I’m eating bone marrow, I didn’t know what a bone marrow fan I fucking am.” And it’s all shit. It’s all fucking bad for you. [laughter] I always… I always feel fatter after… This is the deal, right? I’m recording a special right now, so I’ve dropped, like, seven pounds in a week, by just not fucking eating, just not fucking eating, and… I come from a long line of fat people. Right? I come from fat people. The reason I… I lose weight is because of you, the general public, and your comments on the internet. [laughter] Without you and your words of wisdom, I’d be a fat fuck, but thank God you all come along, and you fucking bully the fuck out of me. [laughter] See, I’m not… I’m not for fat shaming, but I kind of am, I kind of am. [laughter] I’m not for any shaming, really, but I don’t know why we’ve gotten to this moment in society where fat people are immune to being shamed, yet every other addiction in our society is shamed. I watched my mother eat herself to death. I fucking watched it. She hid food, she fucking kept on eating, she denied what she was doing, and she fucking died from it, right? I watched it happen. But for some reason, we have to look at fat people and go, “You be your best self, you’re looking great.” Every other fucking addiction in our society, we shame. You smoke a cigarette… You don’t think smokers feel shame? You don’t think smokers are breathing fucking smoke into their lungs, going, “I’m a piece of shit. I’m a parent, what the fuck am I doing with my life?” We don’t need you to go, “You smell. [laughter] You’re killing yourself, go outside. [laughter] There’s a section for people like you.” [laughter] Like fucking cocaine addicts. You don’t think they feel shame? Every time a cocaine addict has a line, they literally have to look at themselves in the fucking mirror. [laughter] You don’t compliment a fucking meth addict who’s picking scabs off their face, like, “You be you. [laughter] You’re living your best life.” No, but eating, we have to watch people get fat as fuck and compliment them? Fuck off. Should be the same as smoking. A fat cunt comes into a doughnut store, the person behind the counter should be able to go, “You’re gonna have to eat that outside.” [laughter] They’ll go outside with their doughnut… Aww. And they’ll have a little roped-off section. Let’s make it small, give them a fucking incentive. [laughter] They can stand out there with the other fatties and look at each other and go, “Oh.” [laughter] “Do you remember when we were allowed to eat on planes?” [laughter] So, anyway, then we go on through the menu, course number five. Now, these fancy restaurants always have a foie gras course. Foie gras, it’s fucking delicious. I didn’t know what it was for years. I just enjoyed it. It’s this buttery, fucking fleshy thing. It’s delicious. And then someone showed me a video. Do you know how they make foie gras? They get a goose, then they step on its fucking feet, and then they pull the goose’s neck up, like this, and they get what’s called a foie gras funnel, which is like a funnel with a big, long tube, and they shove it down the goose’s throat until the goose looks like a fucking sword swallower. [laughter] And then they force-feed the goose grains, day and night, right? And then after that, they wire the goose’s mouth shut so it can’t vomit the food back up. Because of doing this, the goose gets cirrhosis of the liver, and the liver gets fat and yellow, and that’s what gives it that buttery taste. [laughter] My big question is… [laughter] …who was the first cunt to figure that out? [laughter] Who… Who was the first bloke just to walk up to his mates and just go, “Hey, guys… [laughter] I was torturing geese… [laughter] …as I always do… [laughter] …and you would not believe the delicious side effects.” [laughter] Now, I don’t believe in animal cruelty, uh, but– but who here, uh, thinks that we should no longer test on animals? [cheering and applause] All right! They’re what we call fucking idiots. [laughter] If you’re a fucking moron who just applauded, “There should be no animal testing,” you fucking basic cunt. [laughter] Now, I don’t think we should test on animals for something as frivolous as makeup. But when it comes to medicine, what’s our fucking other option? Let’s just think of something really simple, like acne cream. Right? You can’t just get a cucumber… [laughter] …smear the cream on the cucumber and go, “No change to cucumber. [laughter] Ready for people.” [laughter] No, you’ve got to start with a mouse, don’t you? Smear it on the mouse, that mouse dissolves. [laughter] “First cream not good.” [laughter] Then you get another cream. That mouse fucking multiplies like a mogwai hit with water. [laughter] “Better… [laughter] …than first cream. [laughter] Still… not good.” [laughter] Then you get one where it works. Then you go, “That one’s good.” Then you get a rat. Then you get a rabbit. Then you get a cat, then you get a dog, then you get a primate, then you get a homeless person, a student, then us. [laughter] And that’s how we have the medicine. [laughter] So moving on, we go to fucking course number six. The waiter brings up a cart. This thing has a dome on the top. And he rocks up with this fucking thing with the dome. He carried all the other food, but this thing needs a trolley. [laughter] And he pulls it off and there’s all these cheeses there. And he goes, “Your next course is the fromage,” like that. The fro… Actually, I don’t like that. I don’t like that the cunt called it fromage. [laughter] I know it’s a little thing, but it bothers me. He was just doing it to Frenchie the fucking experience up. [laughter] He could’ve said “cheese,” he knows the fucking word’s cheese. Everything else he said in English, and then he had to say fucking fromage. Fuck that cunt. [laughter] You’re telling me… You’re telling me that he’s, uh… he’s learned the entire English language but he’s just one word short? [laughter] I don’t like that. I’ll be honest with you here, and this is being recorded, and I’m happy to say this to the whole world. My most hated group in society… is Italian Americans. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And… And… And… Look, this is a comedy show, so if there are any Italian Americans in the room with us this evening, please know that you’re not welcome. [laughter] [whistling and applause] You’re a fucking painful bunch of people. [laughter] Pick a fucking accent. Either go Italian or go American, but don’t flip-flop. [laughter] You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the waiter will seem normal, and then he’ll fucking change, right? You’ll be in an Italian restaurant, the guy will go, “Hey, enjoying your meal? It’s good, right? My mother, she used to make it with the mozzarell…” And you’re like… [laughter] “What the fuck happened to that word, cunt?” You… It’s like he had a fucking stroke in the middle of the fucking word. Mozzarell… Fuck you. [laughter] That’s why I got to give it up for the Asians. I like the Asians. [cheering] They pick an accent, and they fucking stick to it. [laughter] The Asians either go full Asian, or they go full American. They don’t go back and forth. [laughter] You’ll never be in an Asian restaurant and have the waiter walk up and go, “Hey, you enjoyed that? You should try it with some soy-soy.” No, they never do that. [laughter] So kudos, Asians. Kudos. [cheering] Anyway, so he rocks up with his fucking cart of cheese. There’s some soft cheeses there, some Camemberts and Bries and whatnot. The most dangerous cheeses of them all. [laughter] And I look at the cheese. And now, this– this girl, she does not know of my condition. [laughter] And I look at the cheeses, I look up at him, and I went, “How long… [laughter] …is the rest of the meal?” [laughter] And he said, “Uh, maybe, uh, 20 minutes.” I went, “Twenty minutes, I’ve got a 15-minute drive. [laughter] Fromage me.” [laughter] And I got myself a big plate of cheese, and I fucking caned that cunt. I fucking ate all that. We got another couple of courses, they have two dessert courses. One of the courses, the dessert courses, might as well have just been called “lactose.” [laughter] It was a lactose crumble, next to a lactose foam, with a lactose reduction, with a scoop of ice cream, then they freeze-dried some lactose crumble table-side and sprinkled it on top. And I looked at it, and I was like this, “In for a penny, in for a pound.” [laughter] And I ate that bowl of lactose as well. Now, what I didn’t mention is the girl I’m on the date with, she is a very petite girl. She had given up around course six. [laughter] I had also eaten her plate of fromage. [laughter] And her bowl of lactose. [laughter] Lactose is now coursing through my veins. I am on borrowed time. [laughter] And so I’m sitting there, knowing. I’m just sort of like, “All right, we’ll be good here. We’ll be good.” You know? I’m listening to her. “Oh, that’s interesting.” [laughter] And then the waiter comes up and goes, “Would you like a coffee?” And I went, “No! [laughter] Just the check, please.” [laughter] So he gets me the check. Now, we’re gonna go back to my place. Now, I’d been on a few dates with this girl, we’d always gone back to her place. This time was the first night she was gonna come back to my house. I was happy about going back to my place ’cause I know where all the toilets are, I know the distance. There’s a lot of things that were going on there. And because she was staying at my place, she goes to me, she goes, “Oh, we have to stop at the pharmacy… because there’s a-a-a cream that I need, like a lotion type of thing.” And I said, “That you need?” [laughter] And I-I-I said, I said, “Are you sure you don’t want it?” [laughter] And she goes, “No, I… No, I need it.” And I said, “I don’t know if you know the difference between wants and needs. [laughter] Like, if you need it, that means that you’ll die… [laughter] …if you don’t have it. So… Do you need it?” [laughter] And she claimed to need it. So… we drove off to the pharmacy. We get in there, right? We walk in this Rite Aid, and there’s just this wall of fucking lotions and that type of stuff, and I thought she needed it so she would know which one to grab. [laughter] But she’s just sort of looking at them, like this. Right? And I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. -[laughter] -Like this. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And she can’t pick one. Now, this is the thing, she has to get a lotion. I don’t understand what’s going on with the whole lotion thing with women, right? I… Okay, I’ve lived with, uh, six girlfriends in my life. [laughter] In my… In my life, I’ve lived with six women, and all six of them have left me. [laughter] And sooner or later, I’m going to blame myself. [laughter] But not today. [laughter] [cheering and applause] Now… [cheering and applause] Now, every single woman I’ve ever lived with has a nighttime ritual, where they… See, I have a bedtime ritual. What I do is I go to the bathroom, I have a piss, I brush my teeth, I go to bed. [laughter] I’ve recently figured out that I could do them at the same time. [laughter] I have a piss and I brush my teeth, and I spit over, like that… Now, but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for, like, 20 minutes, and you close the door. And then you come out, and the last thing you do is you’re sort of… you’re rubbing something here. [laughter] And then you go like this. [laughter] And then you get into bed, and you tell me what I’ve done wrong that day. [laughter] [applause] And that’s your little nighttime routine. [laughter] Now, I don’t know what goes on in that room. [laughter] But I assume, I can’t be positive, but I assume you are covering your body head to toe in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence. [laughter] Now, I’m 42 years old. Um… I-I wear makeup for work. Like, when I’m on TV, they put makeup on me. I never even wipe it off, I just fucking… They give me a towelette, and I go, “Ah, don’t worry about it.” Then… [laughter] It goes away over a week, and they put it back on. [laughter] Apart from that, I-I’ve worn sunscreen, but I’ve never put anything else on my face. Nothing else my entire life. Um, I’m arguably an alcoholic. [laughter] I… I used to be a heavy smoker. I’ve been a cocaine addict. [cheering] [laughter] And my skin is fucking flawless. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And you want to know why? Because my skin learned at a very young age… [laughter] …that it couldn’t rely on me. [laughter] My skin knew that I was not gonna help it, so it was like, “All right… We’re going to have to produce our own oils if we’re gonna keep shit together.” Where women’s skin… Women’s skin… Every day, women’s skin is like this, “I haven’t had my special cream.” [laughter] And that’s why you all age so horribly. [laughter] [cheering and applause] Yeah, I-I don’t… I don’t do… as many misogynistic jokes as I used to, but I like to whip one in there every now and then. [laughter] It’s funny because I didn’t… I used to do more back in the day. But what happened was, in our society, people started getting angry at me because they didn’t know I was joking. Even though my job description would say… [laughter] …that I was possibly joking. [laughter] So this is what happens now with comedians. For some reason, we’re enemy number one. Every time we do a joke that you don’t like, you all go, “Why did you say that?” “Why…” I get asked at interviews, “Why would you say that joke?” And you go, “I thought it was going to be funny.” [laughter] It’s fucking ridiculous. I’m in trouble now for jokes that I did fucking ten years ago. People ring me up and go, “You said this joke ten years ago.” Now, our job as comedians is, okay, if the line’s here, our job is to go right up to the line, that’s our fucking job. To take risks. To gamble, if you will. Now, what happens when you gamble? You don’t always win. [laughter] Otherwise it wouldn’t be called fucking “gambling.” [laughter] So, what happens is we go all the way up to the line, right, which is fine. So, on my specials, I have jokes that have gotten through standards and practices and lawyers and everything, and still gotten on fucking Netflix, and then you watch it years later, and you’re fucking angry. Well, go fuck yourself, right? Because… [cheering and applause] Because… When I told the joke, the line was here, and it was socially acceptable, right? Now you moved the line back to here, so I won’t go there anymore, I won’t, but the line’s here. But you can’t get angry because you moved the line and then the fucking joke was over here. [laughter and applause] And then… And then you have the audacity to ask me to maybe apologize for a fucking joke. Here’s the thing, I wanted the joke to work. Sometimes you tell a joke and it doesn’t fucking work. And then people go, “Why did you do that?” You go, “I tried to make the joke work, but it didn’t fucking work, and now you’re all upset with me.” [laughter] It’s like if a pilot smashes a plane into fucking the side of a mountain. You don’t go, “Why did you do that?” [laughter] He’ll go, “My intention was to land the plane safely. [laughter] But it turns out I failed at my job. But I didn’t… I didn’t wake up in the morning going, ‘Smash it!'” [laughter] See, it’s like, I watched Dave Chappelle’s special. I watched his special. I thought it was fucking great. [cheering and applause] It was hilarious. And people got upset, and they got upset by different jokes in it. They get… See, here’s the thing. I didn’t enjoy every joke in his special. Some of the things he said, I didn’t even agree with. But you know what happened? When I watched the jokes I didn’t enjoy, I got over it because I’m not a fucking pussy. [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right? And I just listened to the ones I fucking enjoyed. See, he said that he thought that Michael Jackson didn’t fuck kids. Eh. [laughter] I think Michael Jackson did fuck kids. [laughter] That’s how me and Dave differ. [laughter] A lot of people have stopped listening to Michael Jackson’s music. They go, “I won’t listen to it anymore. I won’t listen to it anymore.” I still listen to it. [laughter] But I only listen to the Jackson 5. [laughter] ‘Cause if he was fucking kids back then, it was just experimenting, and there’s nothing wrong with that. [laughter] I go all the way to “Blame It on the Boogie,” and I fucking call it a day. [laughter] So, look… [laughter] What I’m trying to tell you is… she couldn’t pick which cream she wanted. [laughter] And she’s looking at all the different creams. I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” box step. [laughter] And I think to myself, “Fuck it, I’ve got to have a shit.” Now, there’s a bathroom in the back of the, uh, pharmacy, so I duck off. Now, at this point of the story, I got to tell you… all right, that this girl’s a germophobe. It’s vital to the story that she’s a germophobe. Now, we may have some people in the room who identify as germophobes and, to those people… go fuck yourself. [laughter, cheering, and applause] I’ve… I’ve never met a person in my life who’s interesting who’s a fucking germophobe. You’re always boring cunts who tell us all the time that you’re a fucking germophobe. Being a germophobe is doing a lot of heavy lifting for your shit fucking personality. [laughter] How dare you act like we’re all diseased. Every time we shake your hand, you go, “I-I can’t because… eh…” Every time you cook with a germophobe, you cook and put some scraps in the bin, you go, “Hey, can you take that out for the trash for me?” And they’re like, “I’d love to, but I can’t. [laughter] Because I’m a germophobe.” And you’re like, “The rest of us are loving it.” You lick the bin, “Aah.” [laughter] You’re not special. While I’m at it, people with peanut allergies can fuck off an’ all. [laughter, cheering, and applause] Now, I’m not saying that there aren’t people with severe peanut allergies. There truly are. There’s people who will die if they eat a fucking peanut. What I’m saying is it’s your fucking problem. [laughter] The rest of us don’t have to be involved. Right, like, have you ever been on a plane lately, and they go like this, they go, “Uh, on today’s flight, we will not be serving peanuts, as there’s a person on the flight with a severe peanut allergy.” And you’re like, “All right, well, don’t give them to them, then.” [laughter] How fucking weak-willed are these cunts? “Oh, I know it will kill me, but the salty goodness…” [laughter] Like, what do they think the rest of us are going to fucking do? Go to the air stewardess, “Uh, excuse me, uh, who has that peanut allergy?” [laughter] [laughter] What do you think’s gonna happen if someone next to you eats a fucking peanut? Do you think peanut particles will get in the fucking air? Guess what? These flights fly back and forth and back and forth all fucking day. In between, they hardly clean the planes. Do you think they’d go on with a special peanut– de-peanut-ing machine and fucking fill the fucking air? [laughter] See, you know what I do? Every time when I’m on a flight where they serve peanuts, what I do is I get six or seven peanuts, and I wedge them down the back of the fucking seat. [laughter] And if someone ever dies, I’ll be the first person to say, “I was wrong.” [laughter] Now, I talked earlier about, like, how I did one misogynistic joke, and how– how, at the moment now, I-I-I don’t know if people know that I’m fucking joking. It’s become very odd now, this tension that we have about what’s right and what’s wrong. I was on a plane and this fucking… This woman was trying to put a bag in the overhead luggage, and she was shaking, and she can’t do it. And I went to help her, and she just looked at me and went, “No, no,” like that. [laughter] And it’s, like, now I’m in trouble for trying to do a nice thing. That used to be my one move. [laughter] I used to open doors, I used to lift bags, I used to stand up for pregnant people on buses. That was my fucking gig. That’s what I had going. -[laughter] And now, because I tried to help her, she’s, like… She’s, like, angry at me? Like I’m trying to do a male patriarchy thing, where I can lift this better than you. So I just told her to fuck off. [laughter] And… turns out, she’s just a woman with Parkinson’s, and she did need my help. [laughter] But that scenario could’ve been different is what I’m saying. [laughter] Like, I was in a movie… I was in a movie with my son. We were watching… A couple of years ago, we were watching the Ghostbusters movie, the new one with the female cast. Watching Ghostbusters. My son, he’s four at the time, and he turns to me watching Ghostbusters, and he goes, “This movie’s not as good as the other Ghostbusters.” And I went, “Shut up, shh. [laughter] You’re not allowed to say that. This movie’s every bit as good as the other Ghostbusters. We’ll talk about it in the car.” [laughter] You know, and on reflection, that movie wasn’t as good. [laughter] It was a shit fucking movie. [laughter] Wasn’t funny, the action sequences weren’t good, it was a fucking shit film. It wasn’t shit because women were in it. It was just shit because it was shit. [laughter] You know what I mean? Like, ’cause that cast… Paul Feig is the director. He directed Bridesmaids, one of my top ten comedies. The rest of the cast was from that movie, they’d made good films together. This one was just a misfire. But the weird thing that happened was no one went to see that film, and then all of a sudden, men were pigs, men are fucking misogynistic assholes because that film didn’t do good. No. It didn’t do good because you women didn’t fucking see it either. If you went and saw the movie… If you went and saw the movie, it would have been a success. But you didn’t fucking see it, then you got angry at us for not fucking seeing it. [laughter] Do you want to know why it didn’t do well? It’s an action comedy, and if you go to any marketing company that talks about how they sell things, action comedies primarily are enjoyed by men. There might be exceptions to the rule, but primarily men like action comedies. Do you want to know why? Because we’re funny, and we do things, and… [laughter] And… And women like dramas because you cause drama. [laughter] [cheering and applause] So my point is… stop remaking our fucking movies. Leave our movies alone. We don’t remake your films. You don’t see Brad Pitt and George Clooney getting together to make Mystic fucking Pizza of the Sisterhood of the Ya-Ya Fuckhead Traveling Pants Movie. [laughter] We leave your shit alone. [laughter] Although there should be some films that should be remade with, you know, different casts. Like, one of my favorite movies from my childhood was, uh, Nine to Five. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda. Fantastic. It still stands up today. It’s about three women, they have a boss who’s a fucking pig. Like, it’s even poignant right now. They have a boss who’s a pig. So what they do is they drug him, and they put him in bondage gear, and they hang him from the roof of one of their garages for three weeks. It’s a fun film. [laughter] You know, they should do that with a male cast, right? So, there’s a woman, you put her in the position of power. [laughter] The three employees don’t like it, so they drug her, and they put her in bondage gear, and they hang her from the roof of one of their garages. It’s just a fun film. [laughter] Another movie that needs an opposite remake: Brokeback Mountain. [laughter] [cheering and applause] That movie’s… It needs it! [laughter] The original film is a couple of blokes, they’re working on the land, they ran out of conversation. So they went into a tent, and they fucked each other in the ass. [laughter] My film, it’s a couple of young lasses, they’re working on the land, they’re doing a man’s job. They get bored, so they go into a tent, and they finger-bang each other. [laughter] [laughter] My version doesn’t even need a tent. [laughter] But one of the things that’s happening in cinema at the moment is, and I think we can all agree on this… Okay, so… So we’re done with blackface people. Stop doing that. People don’t like it. If-If you’re getting ready for Halloween and you think, “I might do blackface,” just don’t. [laughter] It’s so much easier to not do blackface. [laughter] Like you don’t have to do anything. Just save yourself time. See, the thing is, with actors now you’ve got in movies… I think we’ve all agreed that you can’t play outside your race. It goes back to, like, Mickey Rooney playing an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Don’t play outside your race. You can only play your race. I think we can all agree on that now. Now, there’s another thing happening now, where the gays are getting upset if heterosexuals are playing gay people on film. I’m not sure about that, but I’m open to discussion. But here’s the thing that’s really fucking pissing me off. Taron Edgerton, or Egerton, or whatever, he played Elton John and Eddie the Eagle. Two of the ugliest cunts that have ever lived. [laughter] He’s really good-looking. I don’t fucking like that. [laughter] He’s playing uglyface. How many ugly actors would like that fucking opportunity? [yelling] Do the good-looking people need fucking everything? [laughter] Like, Charlize Theron fucking gains 30 pounds, and all they say is, “How brave.” [laughter] You know what’s brave? Being ugly every single fucking day. [cheering and applause] So I decide to go off to the toilet, right? And I’m going off… [laughter] And she goes, “Where are you going?” And there’s no point lying anymore, so I just went like this, “Um… I have to shit myself.” [laughter] And she goes, “If you take a shit in a public toilet, then I’ll never fuck you again.” I was like, [exhales] [laughter] “It’s a very good argument. That’s a… That’s what you call a quandary.” [laughter] So, I went, “All right, but just fucking hurry up.” So now I’m doing the “I have to shit myself” jog. I’m like, “Come on. [laughter] Pick a fucking cream. Pick a cream, any cream. They’re all good. All of these creams are good.” She’s not hurrying up, so I did what every man has done in a relationship. Right? And there’s a few men in this room that probably did it this evening to get here on time. This is how you hurry up your wife or your girlfriend. Every man does this. This is our special move. We go out… and we sit in the car. [laughter] And we think, “This’ll send a strong message.” [laughter] Now, I assume women are like, “Ah, thank fuck he’s gone to sit in the car.” [laughter] So, I’m sitting in the car and I do this move, where I’ve leant like this, I leant all the way down, and I’m trying to breathe through it, like I’m in, like, a Lamaze class, like… [exhales] [exhales] And the reason I’m sitting like this is because my theory is if I lay flat like this, the shit won’t come out as quickly -because of gravity, you see? [laughter] If I sit upright, the shit has an easier way to fall. [man] Yeah! And also, sitting like this, I’m clenching my ass cheeks together. [laughter] Because if the shit gets past the sphincter, it won’t get past the impenetrable barrier that is me clenching my ass cheeks together. Because I’m a fucking genius. [laughter] And I’m sitting there, and I’m watching her through the window of the pharmacy. [laughter] And she selects the cream, but then she stops a bit. Right? Then she goes back to get another cream. So I’ve got to hurry this up, so I start honking, just… Honk! Honk! She looks out like she’s really angry with me. Then she’s going to the counter. I think, “Oh, good, she’s coming.” Then she just, like, bumps into a friend. [laughter] Starts fucking talking to someone. So, I thought, “I’d better step this up a gear.” So, I put the window down, and I lean my head out the window, and every time the sliding doors open like this… [laughter] …I went, “I’m gonna shit myself! [laughter] I’m gonna shit myself!” [laughter] Now… I forget that I’m off the telly. I don’t think about it on a regular basis, right? So, I’m leaning out the window, yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself,” and this 14-year-old kid skateboards by and goes, “Good luck with that, Jim.” [laughter] [applause] So I’m sitting there yelling, “I’m gonna shit myself.” Eventually she comes out, she gets in the car, and, like, obviously she’s upset. She has reason. I have been yelling, “I’m going to shit myself,” and honking the horn. [laughter] She sits next to me and she goes, “I cannot believe…” And I went, “No time to fight! [laughter] This is not a drill.” [laughter] And I fucking fishtail out of the fucking car park. Now I’m in Ventura, and I’m whizzing through traffic. She’s holding on, fucking… The cream’s bouncing around. I see the Golden Arches, I see McDonald’s. I turned to her, I said, “Could I please have a shit in the McDonald’s? [laughter] McDonald’s are renowned for how clean they keep their toilets. I won’t even sit on the seat. I’ll just hover and spray.” [laughter] To that, I received a firm, “No.” [laughter] So I have to make a decision. My house is five minutes away. Her house is three minutes away. I-I make a call. I’ve got to go to her house, it’s the only way I’ll make it, right? Now, this… This kills me. Every day I think about this, right? If I went to her house to begin with, I never would’ve had to stop to get the cream. [laughter] So, anyway, we get into her house… we get in the driveway, she has a long driveway. I park the car. I get out. I’m already like this, “Come on!” “Come on!” [laughter] She’s got the keys, so none of my running’s helping. She’s just fucking in heels, just going through her bag. I’m going, “Come on!” Now she’s stopped being angry, she just finds this hilarious. [laughter] She’s just laughing. We get to the door. Right, now, you know when you’ve really… you’ve… you really have needed to do a shit? It could be five minutes, it could be five hours, but there was an amount of time where you were desperate to do a shit. Then you get to within 12 feet of the toilet. [laughter] And your asshole starts to reward itself… [laughter] for all the good work that you’ve put in. [laughter] Your asshole goes, “Yeah, we did it! [laughter] We did it! We did it as a team! And that’s my favorite thing: that we did it together!” [laughter] ‘Cause you always get to the toilet, you always go… “Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!” Pooooooof! [laughter and applause] You never go… seat… Poof! No. Why is it that you always just made it? You’re not that lucky. There aren’t that many coincidences in the world… [laughter] …that you always just made it. It’s that your asshole has its own brain and a, like, Pavlovian response. So anyway… I get up to the door, and I’m going, “Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!” And I’m, like, really yelling. She walks up, she gets the keys out, she’s laughing. She goes to put the keys in the door, she drops the keys. -[laughter] -[woman] Oh! The keys hit the ground, and I shit myself. [laughter] [applause] And this isn’t just like a little warning squirt of, like, “All right, there’s more where this came from.” And it wasn’t like a full evacuation either. It wasn’t just like a full… “Pooof” like this. It was the weirdest thing. It was just shit coming out of me in a steady meter, just… [laughter] No pushing. [laughter] No pushing. Everything from liquids to solids and everything in between. [laughter] And I’d gone from being all “Aaagh!” to just a calmness… [laughter] …came over me. I was just… [laughter] And my jeans are filling up. [laughter] And instantly, the… the smell of human fecal matter has filled the air. And for the first time, she gets her ass into gear and she goes, “Oh, fuck!” And she grabs the keys… [laughter] And I went, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [laughter] No point hurrying anymore. [laughter] You take your time.” [laughter] [cheering and applause] All right. Now, before I go, I’m gonna tell a very, very quick little story. Um… My mother passed away a few months ago, and, um, when my mother died… Look, my mother, uh was never… Yeah, look, here’s the deal. My mother’s not a– wasn’t a funny woman. She had no… no sense of humor, never found me funny. She never watched anything that I did and went, “That was funny.” But she was always… [laughter] She was always very supportive of me. And, you know, the only per… she was the only one in my life, the only one, that I bagged on my mother so much, I called her Gunta, she was the butt of so many fucking jokes that I said. And I’ll give her this, she never complained, not fucking once. Not once. [cheering and applause] So… I’d like to tell one story where she comes out of it a little bit cooler. Right? Now, when I was about 13 and my brother was about 17, we were home watching, uh, Star Wars. Right? We were home watching Star Wars. I was on the Throne of Misery, my brother was on the couch, watching Star Wars. My brother Scott, who’s a fucking nutjob, right, he turns to me and he goes, “Hey, Jim, get me a Coke.” And I went, “Get your own fucking Coke, I’m not gonna get you a Coke.” And he goes, “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” [laughter] “What? What?” [laughter] “Get me a Coke or I’ll piss on the carpet.” I go, “I’m not getting you a fucking Coke.” And he’s going, “So you’d rather I just pissed on the carpet?” I go, “I guess that’s what I’m fucking telling you.” [laughter] And my brother walks to the middle of the living room, stands in front of me, gets out his cock, starts pissing on the carpet, and he looks at me and he goes, “I don’t know why you constantly find the need to cause trouble. [laughter] It would have been so easy for you just to get a Coke, but, no, not Jim, has to be difficult.” Then he shakes his cock, puts it away, goes back, lies down. Now, this is the bit that fucking kills me. [laughter] He doesn’t get a Coke. [laughter] So, I was sitting there, you know, 40 degrees Celsius, no air conditioning, fucking… a puddle of urine in the middle of the living room, just steaming upwards. Now we’re onto about… We’re probably on Return of the Jedi by now. My mom comes in, and she does that thing that parents do when they have no words. She walks in, just to see the urine in the middle, and she went like this, “Why? [laughter] Who… Who would… Who would… Why?” [laughter] And then she went, “Every fucking day it’s something different. Every day.” [laughter] And then she went, “Who did this?” And I didn’t want to get in trouble, so I went, “Scott did it.” And she turned to Scott and she goes, “What did you do that for?” And he went, “I told Jim to get me a Coke, or I’d piss on the carpet.” [laughter] And my mother turns to me and goes… [imitates hard slap] [laughter] “Why didn’t you get him a Coke? You know he’s fucking mental.” [laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. [cheering and applause] Good night. I appreciate it, I really do.

       "'Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night! Prolefeed.

 hey  it was nice when we stole it  it looked pretty good  it was pristine  paradise  have you seen it lately  have you taken a good look at it lately  it’s fucking embarrassing  only a nation of unenlightened half wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today  a shopping mall  a big  fucking shopping mall  you know that  that’s all you got  that’s all you got here  folks  mile after mile of mall after mall  many  many malls  major malls and mini malls  they put the mini malls in between the major malls  and in between the mini malls they put the mini marts  and in between the mini marts  you’ve got the car lots  gas stations  muffler shops  laundromats  cheap hotels  fast food joints  strip clubs and dirty bookstores  america the beautiful  one big transcontinental commercial cesspool  and how do the people feel about all this  how do the people feel about living in a coast to coast shopping mall  well  they think it’s just fucking dandy  they think it is as cool as can be  because americans love the mall  they love the mall  that’s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time  shopping and eating  millions of semiconscious americans day after day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating  especially eating  americans love to eat  they are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food  hot dogs  corn dogs  triple bacon cheeseburgers  deep fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheesewhiz  mayonnaise soaked barbecue  mozzarella patty melts  america will eat anything  anything  anything  shit if you were selling saut ed raccoons assholes on a stick  americans would buy them and eat them  especially if you dipped them in butter and put a little salsa on them  this country is big time pig time  forget the bald eagle  you know what the national emblem of this country ought to be  a big bowl of macaroni and cheese  a big bowl  because everything in this country is king size  king size  extra large and super jumbo  especially the fucking people  have you seen some of the people in this country  have you taken a good look at some of these big  fat motherfuckers walking around  big  fat motherfuckers  oh  my god  huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of interstate buses  the people in this country are immense  massive bellies  monstrous thighs and big  fat fucking asses  and if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them  you’ll look at one of them and you begin to wonder  how does this woman take a shit  how does she shit  and even more frightening  how does she wipe her ass  can she even locate her asshole  she must require assistance  are paramedics trained in this field  and standing right next to her  of course  with a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of pie is her clueless fucking husband joe six pack  with his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckle  this guy ain’t seen his dick since the nixon administration  and if you stand there and you look at the two of them  you begin to wonder to yourself  do these people fuck  is this man actually capable of fucking this woman  it doesn’t seem structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration  maybe they’re in that  cirque du soleil  or something  i’m telling you the people in this country   every one of them   is    pounds overweight  they are gargantuan  and in the summertime   god help us   in the summertime they will all want to wear short pants  jesus lord  protector of all that is good and holy  deliver us from fat people in short pants  they all got short pants  big bellies  fat thighs and dumb kids  short pants  big bellies  fat thighs and dumb kids  every one of them has got two dumbass kids with them  and the whole family is wearing t shirts  and every one of them has got the same t shirt   i’m with stupid   apparently in this country  the stupids are an extended family  and besides wearing them t shirts  everyone in the family has got on a backpack  they got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid shit  and the reason they got to carry their stupid shit strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold food  and to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting shit they ate that day  and  another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid shit  they ain’t got enough stupid shit at home  they just had a stupid shit sale  they’re gonna buy more  they’re going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big  fat  ugly  oversized suv that’s got plenty of room in it  plenty of room in it for stupid shit and lots of room left over for these big  fat  ugly motherfuckers to get them home  stopping on the way  of course  for jelly roll and fried dough  these people  these people are efficient  professional  compulsive consumers  it’s their civic duty  consumption  it’s the new national pastime  fuck baseball  it’s consumption  the only true lasting american value that’s left  buying things  buying things  people spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need  money they don’t have on things they don’t need  so they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying    percent interest on something that cost        and they didn’t like it when they got it home anyway  not too bright  folks  not too fucking bright  but if you talk to one of them about this  if you isolate one of them  you sit them down rationally  and you talk to them about the low iq’s and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions  right away they start talking about education  that’s the big answer to everything  education  they say  we need more money for education  we need more books  more teachers  more classrooms  more schools  we need more testing for the kids   you say to them   well  you know  we’ve tried all of that and the kids still can’t pass the tests   they say   don’t you worry about that  we’re going to lower the passing grades   and that’s what they do in a lot of these schools now  they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass  more kids pass  the school looks good  everybody’s happy  the iq of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a fucking pencil  got a pencil  get the fuck in there  it’s physics  then everyone wonders why    other countries graduate more scientists than we do   educaation   politicians know that word  they use it on you  politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things  the flag  the bible and children   no child left behind  no child left behind   oh  really  well  it wasn’t long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start  head start  left behind  someone is losing fucking ground here  but there’s a reason  there’s a reason  there’s a reason for this  there’s a reason that education sucks  and it’s the same reason that it will never ever  ever be fixed  it’s never going to get any better  don’t look for it  be happy with what you got  because the owners of this country don’t want that  i’m talking about the real owners now  the real owners  the big  wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions  forget the politicians  they’re irrelevant  the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice  you don’t  you have no choice  you have owners  they own you  they own  everything   they own all the important land  they own and control the corporations  they’ve long since bought and paid for the senate  the congress  the state houses  and city halls  they got the judges in their back pocket  and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear  they’ve got you by the balls  they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying  lobbying to get what they want  well  we know what they want  they want more for themselves and less for everybody else  but i’ll tell you what they don’t want  they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking  they don’t want well informed  well educated people capable of critical thinking  they’re not interested in that  that doesn’t help them  that’s against their interest  that’s right  they don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard    fucking years ago  they don’t want that  you know what they want  they want obedient workers  obedient workers  people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay  the longer hours  the reduced benefits  the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it  and now  they’re coming for your social security money  they want your fucking retirement money  they want it back  so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street  and you know something  they’ll get it  they’ll get it all from you sooner or later  because they own this fucking place  it’s a big club and you ain’t in it  you and i are not in the big club  by the way  it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe  all day long beating you over the head  and their media telling you what to believe  what to think and what to buy  the table is tilted  folks  the game is rigged and nobody seems to notice  nobody seems to care  good  honest  hard  working people  white collar  blue collar  it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on  good  honest  hard working people continue  these are people of modest means  continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them  they don’t give a fuck about you  they don’t care about you  at all  at all  at all  yeah  you know  and nobody seems to notice  nobody seems to care  that’s what the owners count on  the fact that americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red  white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day  because the owners of this country know the truth  it’s called the american dream  because you have to be asleep to believe it  your email address will not be published  required fields are marked   name  e mail

but better  well  i’ve actually turned up  so  thank you and welcome to my new show  humanity  i don’t know why i called it that  i’m not a big fan  i prefer dogs  obviously  dogs are better people than people  aren’t they  they’re amazing  dogs  they’re our best friends  they guard us  they guide us  there’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got  aids  i’m not a doctor  but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours  so they go   cor  you’re well hiv  fuck   you know  and you go   you can smell aids on someone   yeah   why didn’t you smell it on the bloke i brought home last night  you fucking idiot   they did the first three billion years by themselves  evolution and all that  then we got involved and did some selective breeding  getting them how we wanted  to do jobs for us  bit stronger  faster  whatever  they’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do  they love the job they’re bred to do  they’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior  although  the rhodesian ridgeback was bred to hunt lions  i can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out  so we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around  a big passing out parade  there’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard  he goes   right  dogs   they go   what    who wants to know what job they got    we all do  we all do    okay  labradors    yeah    do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks    yeah    that’s your job    amazing  that is amazing  that is my favorite job  that is my favorite job    jack russells     yeah     you like shooting down rabbit holes     yeah     that’s your job    fuckin’ hell  best day ever  best day ever     miniature poodles     yeah    do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals     yeah     that’s your job   that’s your job   ridgebacks    yo    you’re hunting lions    what    you’re hunting lions    fuck off     yeah  you are     no  we’re not  look  lions  we’ll get fucking mashed  why can’t the rottweilers hunt lions    they’re shaking babies   good boy  good boy  you shake that baby if you want  good boy  cheers  this is my first new stand up for seven years  if you don’t count the golden globes  which you shouldn’t  the golden globes  very different  god  a different vibe  two hundred million people watching  and it’s live  big thrill  but with that many people watching  there’s a bit of stick  everyone’s different  everyone’s a blogger  everyone goes   i was offended     why     he said an horrible thing    he said loads of horrible things    yeah  but that was a thing that i care about   that’s the thing about offense  it’s about personal feelings  i don’t care about the backlash   comedian in hot water   you know  my girlfriend  jane  she worries  and she reads things   what have you said    don’t worry  they won’t come to the house  fuck ’em   so i wind her up  i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would  i have to make up worse jokes than i actually  just to scare my girlfriend  when i do the golden globes  we go out about a week before  it’s in la  we fly out  i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches  they release more presenters  i take my pick   i got a good intro for them  yeah  mel gibson  i’ll introduce him  yes   about three days before this last one  just to wind jane up  i said   i got a good intro   she went   what   i said   bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch  please welcome helen mirren   i didn’t do it  she said   you won’t do that   i said   no   next day  i got her again  i said   is this too much   i said   not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast  please welcome melissa mccarthy   i didn’t do it  i would never  i’d never  tell a joke like that  it’s horrible  i was just doing it to annoy jane  i’d never even  think  of that  so don’t  even on the day  on the way to the red carpet  in the limo  i said   i’ll start with a funny one liner  an old fashioned joke   she went   what   i said   what did the deaf  dumb and blind orphan get for christmas   jane went   i don’t know   i said   cancer   i didn’t do it  so  you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist  so  i’d never say that in public  so  to anyone who mattered  anyway  so  don’t  i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone  it just happens  the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke  outrage on twitter the next day  i mean a couple of people going   it was transphobic   it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest  it was a joke about a trans person  but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence  and that’s the other thing about offense  people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target  they’re not necessarily the same  i’ll tell you the joke  you make your minds up  it’s live  so they go   your host for the   th annual golden globes awards  please welcome ricky gervais   they’re all clapping  the actors are smiling at me  nervously  it’s brilliant  right  so  i just go   relax  i’m gonna be nice tonight  i’ve changed  not as much as bruce jenner  obviously   and i go   now caitlyn jenner  of course   and what a year she’s had  became a role model for trans people everywhere  bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes  she didn’t do a lot for women drivers   that’s a clever joke  i’ll tell you why  right  it’s layered  no  listen  right  the subject of that joke is stereotypes  i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes  i start by saying she’s a real woman  a liberal  progressive attitude  then if she’s a real woman  i hit them with the old fashioned stereotype  she must be a bad driver  then  right  the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car  let’s not forget that  shall we  a celebrity killing someone in their car  running home and popping on a dress  that’s  the target of the joke  just so we’re clear  okay  she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers  now cancelled  and  one of the press said   what do you think of the ricky gervais joke   she went   maybe i should host the golden globes   and they tweeted that and   ed me in  because they want a celebrity feud  it was clickbait  i rose to the bait  obviously  i just sent back   let her host  just don’t let her drive   another website that was in the room  entertainment weekly  they tweeted a different headline  and they   ed me in  their headline was  caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais   i just sent back   at last  she always brakes too late   bring it on  bring it on  but i’m a considered comedian  i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair  so i was engaging these people  saying   why is it transphobic   they said   it’s about a trans person   that’s ridiculous  that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist  it depends on the joke  but i’m willing to learn  i found out my crime was that i dead named her  i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes  and that was saying her old name  and even acknowledging she used to be a man  but she did  i saw him on the olympic games  he was a decathlete  he was in everything  all over the place  shot put and pole vault  he won a medal  he was famous  he was on telly all the time  you know  a big  famous  man  with a huge  i don’t know  i’m guessing  probably  he was big  but i’ve learnt my lesson  now i know it’s wrong  i’d never dead name her now  but  years ago  when she was a  man  years ago  i’m saying  and she went to the  doctor  and  knocked on the door  the doctor went   come in   this is years ago  i’d never dead name her now  but this is like  a flashback before anyone  you know what  so  so  like   come in   and he went   hello  bruce jenner   because that  that was his name  then  the doctor  this was years ago  the doctor went   all right  bruce jenner  how you doing  you fucker  you big old lunk  how you doing  come here  you  you fucker  how you doing  brucie boy   and bruce jenner  that was his name  this is years ago  right  so  bruce jenner went   yeah  yeah  not too bad  doctor  yeah    what can i do for you  bruce  you fucker  how you doing  boy   and bruce jenner went  that was his name  bruce jenner went   look at that   the doctor went   come on  bruce jenner  you know the rules   he uses his whole name every time  for some reason   come on  bruce jenner  you fucker  you know the rules  you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here  mate   bruce jenner went   no  that’s not my pole  that’s my enormous penis    well  seeing as it’s your penis  you can bring it in here  but you should have left your shot puts outside   and bruce jenner went  that was his name for  fifty eight years  i think  he went   no  they’re not my shot puts  doctor  they’re my enormous testicles   that’s where i keep my testosterone  and my spunk  and shit  right  and the doctor went   oh yeah  that makes perfect  i’m a medical man  you’re a big bloke  you fucker  how you doing  boy  you’re a big  you’re big  and you would have a big old  cock and  balls  they’re beautiful   bit familiar  innit   no  you must be very proud of them  bruce   bruce went   this is going to surprise you  doctor  i wanna get rid of them   and the doctor went   what  why    oh  they get in the way    in the way of what    fucking driving  for one thing   so  i’m engaging these people  and i’m saying   but i had to say her old name  that’s the joke  i say   i’ve changed  not as much as bruce jenner   then i do the joke   but  no  this is my second crime  i say  she hasn’t changed  she’s always identified as a woman  that means she’s a woman  fine  if that’s the rules  if you feel you’re a woman  you are  i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far  in fact  i don’t think it’s going far enough  cause i’ve always identified as a chimp  right  well  i am a chimp  if i say i’m a chimp  i am a chimp  pre op  but  don’t ever dead name me  don’t call me ricky gervais again  from now on  you call me bobo  i’m gonna have species realignment  i’m halfway there  i’m short  with short legs and long arms  i stoop  my back’s getting hairier by the day  i’ve got fangs  like that  i love nuts  i love nuts  once  i was at the zoo  and people were looking at me  so i just started masturbating  like  so  i am a chimp  right  i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp  i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year  then have hormones  get me all nice and hairy  that’d be lovely  i’m gonna stay a male chimp  so i can keep all that  right  male  heterosexual chimp  keep the same girlfriend  jane would be happy  she loves me  she loves chimps  so  you know  i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp  we’re so close  than for a man to turn into a woman  in many ways  a bit of hair  and a top lip like that  as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off  and a hole gouged out  into  i’m not a doctor  but that is  the gist of it  i know which one i’d rather have done  i’m not saying chimps are better than women  no way  right  any ladies here  i can’t see you  but  to me  every single one of you is equal  to a chimp  so  so  i’d have all that done  hair and that  i’d do all that  all the  i’ll retain the ability to speak english  like in emergencies  i’m talking to jane  she’s going   what is it    what is it  bobo    you left the fucking oven on  there’s a fire   are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf  and there was a big fence but she had a long pole  she’d  revert  she’d be over that fucking  easy  so i’d have all that done  top lip  doing all that  right  i’ll be legally a chimp  i’ll be well  properly chimped up  i’ll be able to use chimp toilets  i’ll be walking along  holding jane’s hand   come on  bobo   right  we don’t hold hands now  i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp  but we’ll be all in love  maybe matching jumpers   come on  bobo   in love  just two  like that  then  if a bigot in a van slows down and goes   that’s fucking disgusting   i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree  and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic  so  cheers  so  humanity  what is humanity  what are we  well  we’ve touched upon it there  we’re great apes  not metaphorically  we’re literally great apes  we are       genetically identical to a chimpanzee  we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas  we left our common ancestor about six million years ago  we have the same life cycle  same as any other animal  which is  our parents mate  we’re born  we grow  we mate  our parents die  our friends die  and then we die  now  my seven year old niece didn’t like hearing that  but i said   you’ve gotta learn  stop crying   i said   you’re seven  you know  today  so  any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled  so   let’s take the first of those  birth  it’s odd  because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period  i mean  because of our evolution  our brain is so big  we have to get that huge head out early  that’s why the skull is in parts and supple  then we go on gestating outside the womb  that’s why we’re so useless  look at other mammals  a giraffe is walking along  it goes   i’m proper pregnant   right  i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here  yeah  there it is  see you later  and the baby goes   mum   it’s got to be fucking ready  we’re  we’re helpless  right  just think  nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment  everything’s  it’s like being in a little kate bush video  right  then  suddenly  you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass  you’re covered in shit  there’s screaming  you go   i can’t breathe   someone goes   yes  you fucking can   the first one second of life on earth  you don’t know where you are  you can’t choose where you’re born  i was born in whitley estate in reading  right  i wouldn’t have chosen that  i’d have chosen hampstead  i did choose hampstead  it just took    years to be able to afford it  very different  very different  my upbringing to how i live now  now i live a privileged life  hampstead is ridiculous  it’s a rarefied place  it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me  new money  right  but  growing up  it was tough  i don’t know about now  but in my day  my estate was rough and scary  it felt like wildlife  i was weak and vulnerable  there was danger round every corner  my school was on my street and i ran there every day  so i didn’t get mugged or molested  there weren’t many pedophiles in reading  the murderers had killed a lot  but there was still a couple  i moved to hampstead  oh my god  there’s no crime  i saw a knife once in hampstead  it was a palette knife  just a bloke  oil painting  in the middle of the street  broad daylight  no one gobbing on it or calling him  bender   it was weird  i know my life has changed drastically  it wasn’t always like that  as a famous person  you read about yourself  gossip and twitter and everything  one thing kept cropping up  even as i prepared for this tour  people kept saying   he’s out of touch  he’s so famous  he’s rich  he’s mega rich   i am  right  i could have this place burnt down for a laugh  no  but they say things like   he’s an observational comedian  how can he say things that relate to ordinary  scum   and i say   i say   don’t call them scum  right   but even the papers  they try and  get around to it  i do interviews and they’ll always say   do you always fly first class   i go   no  often private   right  the number of times i’ve answered this question  they say   do you know how much a pint of milk is   to make you look out of touch  i don’t know  but that’s irrelevant  next time a journalist asks me  i’ll say   i don’t know  but here’s a grand  run and get me one   is that enough  that enough  yeah  another question i always get  particularly with the posh sundays  doing a profile piece  they’re still trying to alienate you  make you look different  they say things like   you don’t have children   i say   no    why don’t you have children   which is an odd question  why don’t you have children  as opposed to asking people   why do you have children   let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight  shall we  nine  that one just fell out  that one didn’t even touch the sides  or  disturb her cigarette  that one just  go and claim for that  people say it’s selfish to not have children  how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level  there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going   we want to be born   right  but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children  three main reasons and i’ll share them with you  three reasons  one  there’s millions  the world’s over populated  no one’s going   rick’s not having kids  we’re gonna run out  fuck   two  kids are scroungers  aren’t they  i mean  from day one  it’s all  me  me  me   isn’t it   feed me    clothe me    pay for my chemotherapy   no  no  not my problem  son  not mine  luck of the draw  boy  luck of the draw  it costs the average household in the west          to bring up a child  and they don’t want to pay you back  they’re not grateful  they don’t go   thanks for having me   it’s  i didn’t wanna be born   even if they get a top job  which they won’t  you’ll never see that money back  they’ll just put you in a home  okay  and my kid  he’d be born into ridiculous wealth  wouldn’t he  so  he’d be a little cunt  a little hampstead cunt  running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts  being all hampstead and cunty   i’m a little hampstead cunt   yes  i know   these are my cunty friends   i know  it’s obvious  i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts  you little posh hampstead  first  he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt   i’m a little   yes  we know  everyone knows  right  he’d know that  right  on the other hand  he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad  i’d say   i worked my way up from nothing  and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt   he’d go   yeah   and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit  eleven  twelve  he’d be naughty  run with the wrong crowd  try and get out from under my shadow  then he’d turn to drugs  about     he’d come home  and overdose on my afghan rug  twenty grand  that was  right  and as he was there  convulsing  and throwing up his fucking lungs  right  and with his little posh  high pitched  fucking death rattle  his little fucking dying words  he’d go   do you love me now  daddy   no  no  no  i never did  that’s why you’ll never be born  you useless  fucking junkie  hampstead cunt  and  three  i’d worry sick about him  you know  no i would  i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her  i check the door three times when i go out  so she doesn’t escape  i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish  a human baby  oh my god  the responsibility of a human life  i’d watch it sleep  you know  we said how weak and vulnerable they are  oh  my god  you perfect little thing  oh  you flesh of my flesh  now  go to sleep in your expensive cot  like that  night  night  sleep tight  don’t let the bedbugs  dead  yeah  just  why  why is it dead  it’s just fucking dead  look  fuck’s sake  fucking hell  what the  what a fucking waste of time that was  fuck’s sake  embarrassing   jane     what     come here     i’m in the shower     come here    what    fucking dead already  i didn’t  just fucking  fucking hell  jane  you call that a baby  that is   if jane was out  i’d have to text her  wouldn’t i  what could you   baby’s dead   she’d come back   what the fuck   i’d go   yep  forget the pampers  lol   but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years  and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables  with their sharp edges  i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it  cave its head in and die  then social services come round and say   is this your child  mr  gervais     yeah     what happened here  then   i go   it’s a fucking idiot   i did think of adopting for a while  a little third world child  because that would tick all three boxes  one  i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem  i’d be alleviating an existing problem  a young kid born  through no fault of his own  into abject poverty  he would have died  i can literally save his life  and give him a great upbringing  right  two  he would be grateful  wouldn’t he  he’d wanna pay me back  woudn’t he  particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky  they didn’t  they didn’t make it out  right  i’d tell him that early on  so he really bucked his ideas up  i’d go   tunde  come here  come here  yeah  yeah  go and pop a shirt on  you’re not in africa now  that’s better  yeah  tunde  look  yeah  water straight out of a tap  innit  yes  yeah  yeah  no  it’s not free  it’s hampstead  you know  but  yeah  course it’s safe  safe  fresh drinking water  have as much as you want  have a bucket full  fresh drinking water  there you go  go and clean the car  go on   no  i’d go   look  remember all your friends in the village back in africa  they’re all dead  a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead   do you wanna pay me back     yeah    yeah  i bet you do   the good thing about them is  they can start work when they’re about  six  i just call up nike and i go   do you still make your stuff in sweatshops  got a great little worker here  yeah  pound a day’s fine  he’s gotta start somewhere  and  three  if he ran round and caved his head in  and died  and social services came round and said   is this your child  mr gervais   i’d go   does it look like mine   i’d go   this is hampstead  it’s obviously broken in   that’s why i don’t have kids  even though i don’t have children of my own  people still show me photos of theirs  like i give a shit  i don’t mean my own family  they’ve given up  i’ve got older brothers and sisters  they’ve had loads of kids  and their kids have kids  and then their kids  there’s about     i don’t know all their names  i see them at christmas  it’s all  uncle ricky   they know i’ve got a bit of cash  they go through my pockets  and then fuck off  it’s like being mugged by mice  right  i don’t mean them  i mean strangers  i could be busy  i could be working  like on the set of a tv or film or something  stressed  producing or directing it  you get someone who’s in for one day  with one line  or a stuntman  they introduce themselves   good  be with you in a minute   then they hover    busy    i go   yeah  yes  yeah   they go   working the weekend   i go   not filming  but i’ll be in the edit    i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons    ah  great  great    yeah  she’s eight    i’ve got a photograph   i go   you know what  show me it if she goes missing  i’ll keep an eye open in the woods   you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole  and go   she’s beautiful   it’s gotta be long  too short  it’s awkward  they know  you go   yeah  right   too long and it’s like   she’s  she’s fucking beautiful   it’s a minefield  innit  so  i’m not out of touch  but i am spoiled  there’s a difference  i didn’t have any money until i was     i’ve got the same family  friends and values  but i am spoiled  because opportunity and privilege spoils you  and it doesn’t take much  i’l give you an example  when i first made it in america  the next time we flew  we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing  and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side  the first time  you’re horrified   everyone’s looking   pretending to be late  baseball cap  oh  god  next time we flew  i went   where’s that bloke  i’m not queueing   it’s quick  when i fly to the states  i’ve got a place there  but i’m always working  so  someone else is paying  so  i go first class  ba  it doesn’t get any better  even if i was paying  i’d still go first class  but jane would probably be in coach  it’s ten grand a pop  that new planet of the apes movie’s on  she’ll love that  she’ll be up for that  but when someone else is paying  i say   jane  get up here with me   right  front two seats  they board us early  we’re on the plane about    minutes before anyone else  god  they bring round these snacks  these warmed  caramelized nuts in a bowl  champagne  it’s great  it’s like a day off  no phone or anything  it’s like a holiday  flying to the states  i could do without the safety video  that’s always a bit of a downer  and totally pointless  if you hit the side of a mountain at     miles per hour  the brace position does fuck all  imagine if that worked  you’re going down  the plane smashes  you go   i’ll try it   you do that  ball of flames  you wake up  everyone’s dead  you go   fucking hell  that’s amazing  that is   and they always use that voice  don’t they  that calming  hypnotic voice  like   nothing bad will happen   they’re saying horrendous things  but nothing bad will happen  because i’m using this voice  don’t worry  things like   in the event of the plane landing on water   it smashes the fuck to bits  right  they say   in the event of the plane landing on water  your life jacket is equipped with a whistle   a fucking whistle  so  the plane hits the water  smashes to bits  everyone’s dead  except you  by a miracle  you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean  four degrees  that water is  you’ve got about    minutes before hypothermia sets in  or you’re eaten by a shark  or you drown  you’re hoping they’ve sent air sea rescue  you’re going   god  i’m gonna die  i don’t know what i’m doing   hold on  i mean  air sea rescue  i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter  o course you haven’t  but  they’re fucking loud  it’s like having your head in a washing machine  you have to wear ear plugs and defenders  your teeth rattle  it’s like  like that  over the atlantic ocean at night  never gonna happen  if you crash  you die  right  but apart from that  it’s brilliant  right  i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas  right  boarded us early  on the plane  she comes round   champagne in a wine glass  like you like it  mr  gervais   she goes off  i go   have you got any of them warm nuts   she went   we’re not handing out nuts on this flight  a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic  even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction   i went   oh  my god  of course   i was fuming  i mean  what’s that got to do with me  why can’t i eat nuts  just cause  fucking  this woman will  die  right  nuts  how has she lived this long  if walking by a nut kills you  if being  just near a nut  how has she never been near a nut  before  and how has she lived long enough  having never been near a nut  how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane  right  honestly  it’s  and if being near a nut kills you  do we really want that in the gene pool  i mean  i never wanted nuts more  i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts  and this is how spoiled i am  okay  i actually had this thought  i thought   oh  i wish i’d brought my own nuts on   right   i thought for a second  but that wouldn’t work  she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog  right  like that  and  die  and someone would go   ricky gervais brought his own nuts on   you know  right  so i don’t take my own nuts on  now  before i fly  i have a shower  and then i rub myself all over  in nuts  just in case  then i go   can i have any nuts   they go   no  sorry  this lady would die    yeah  not a problem   lady gets on  sits down  starts blowing up like a frog  i go   what’s the matter   i touch her all over   what’s the matter   she goes   nuts   right  and dies  and i go   who’s been eating nuts   i get off scot free  so i got to america  i went on a chat show  tonight show with jimmy fallon  and i told that story  the whole thing  it went well  audience laughed  great  went out  next day on twitter  outrage  by  outrage   i mean one person going   how dare you   this woman goes   i saw you on jimmy fallon  making fun of nut allergies  my daughter’s nut intolerant  how dare you   i go   who is this woman   she’s tweeted    times  she starts   ing nbc and jimmy fallon  i go   what’s this  how many followers  twenty three  ignore it   you know when you’re being told off  and they use your own words against you  like a teacher going   so  you find so and so funny   and cause the teacher’s really angry  yes  you do find that thing funny  whatever  she said   would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog   yeah  yeah  you saying that  yes  if you said that at the funeral  i would  yeah  so  someone else gets involved  ohio moms against nuts  right  and she does a blog  and they’re talking to each other  and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am  one filmed her little girl  put it on youtube  and sent me it  i opened it  sweet little girl  seven years old  and she went   dear mr  gervais  i have a fatal nut allergy   delete  not my problem  right  ignore  ignore  ignore  right  but then one of them said something that reeled me in  just cause i’m this self confessed twitter police  i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means  particularly in the context of comedy  and in the context of a joke  a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing  or necessarily condoning the bad thing  it could be anti the bad thing  it depends on the actual joke  and this woman said   you should never make jokes about food allergies   i should have left it  right  i sent back   i make jokes about aids  cancer  famine  and the holocaust  and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies   she sent back   yes  but the holocaust didn’t kill children   well  it did  didn’t it  it was horrible  the holocaust  some would say as bad as food allergies   didn’t kill children   jesus  it did kill children  hitler killed    million people  many of them children  i have to say  hitler  you couldn’t make him up  the worst human being to walk the face of the earth  he is a crazy  evil  racist  narcissistic serial killer  just terrible  but  if i was throwing a dinner party  and i’d been slaving over a hot stove  and i was getting everything ready  and there was one place left  and i had to  either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies  i know who’d ruin that party more  everyone’s enjoying it   everything okay    ja  ist yummy   right  he’s loving it  i go   cheers  you fucker  how you doing  boy   she’s going   i can’t eat that   fucking hell   who wants ferrero rocher    me    all right  here    i can’t eat them   oh  fuck off home  right  that’s what the world’s like  people see something they don’t like  they expect it to stop  as opposed to deal with their emotions  they want us to care about their thing as much as they do  it’s why the world is getting worse  and the world is getting worse  i think i’ve lived through the best    years of humanity       to       the peak of civilization  for everything  for tolerances  for freedoms  for communication  for medicine  now it’s going the other way a bit  last couple of years  just a little blip  maybe  i’m not saying this because i’m old  old people say things like   oh  everything was better when i was a kid   course it was  you were a kid  everything’s better when you’re a kid  being old is the shit bit  whatever’s happening  being old is  i wake up these days  and i go   oh fuck  i didn’t die   gotta do it all again  i’m usually hung over  headache  liver pains  i can’t walk for the first five minutes  ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees  i’m getting fat again now  right  i was thin till i was about     proper skinny  like nine and a half stone  then i got a job  right  and the next  sort of     years were what i call my eating years  and i just got steadily fatter and fatter  until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness  when i was about    years old  there was one christmas  i was at home  lying on the floor  and  i was saying to jane   i’m having a heart attack   right  and  honestly  my heart rate was like      i felt nauseous  i had palpitations  i was sweating  because i’d eaten eleven sausages  true story  right  i was like one of them snakes  like when you see a big  like  python swallow a pig whole  and then it’s just fucked  it’s  like  it’ll sit there for a week  it’s like a duffel bag  just there  like that  that was me  right  i wasn’t having a heart attack  but it worried jane  she said   you gotta look after yourself   i thought   you’re right       so i started working out  right  every day  i didn’t give anything up  i don’t eat meat anymore  but i was having            calories a day  including wine every night  but i burnt it off the next day  just so i could do all that  i worked out every day  running  weight training  i had more time on my hands than the average person  i had a gym in my house  i had no excuse  i lost    pounds  it was great  but now  i still eat and drink too much  but i physically can’t  burn off the calories  i can’t do enough  cause i’m so old and broken and tired  so  i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again  and this time i am going to die  i’m losing my hair  it’s getting really thin  i know it looks great from there  cheers  but  no  honestly  in a lift  with that light directly overhead  and the mirror  it looks like an x ray  right  i’ll have to buzz that off soon  i’d never wear a wig  oh  my god  if you wear a wig or a toupee  and you think you’ve got away with it  you haven’t  everyone knows  everyone knows immediately  my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do  right  i could be at a party  it’ll go   there’s a wig in here    i go   is there     yes  there is  yeah   spidey senses for the wig  it’s obvious  the way they smile  like nothing’s wrong  hiya  it’s the telltale signs  isn’t it  i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald  great bloke  he’s dead now  died a few years ago  i was only little  he went bald in his twenties  tragically bald  his hair fell out  it might have been something like alopecia  but he was bald for ten years into his thirties  turns up one day at our house   elvis  what is   i was about eight  i said to auntie edna   what happened   she went   it was a miracle   they were lying  they were just  everyone knew he was bald  but he’d embroiled his family in the lie  so they had to lie as well  they’re going   yeah  it just grew back   there’s so much he wouldn’t do  cause he was terrified of the wig coming off  we weren’t allowed balloons at parties  right  auntie edna said   reg is allergic to balloons   he wasn’t allergic  he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater  and his wig would fly across the room  we’ve got photos in the family album  if he’s at a wedding or a christening  and he’s holding a baby  it’s always at arms’ length  like that  so it can’t grab his wig  it must have been on his mind all the time  right  it was the only thing he feared  the wig coming off in public  and this ridiculous lie being exposed  he was in the army  hard as nails  he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything  spiders  snakes  cancer  how’s the chemo going  uncle   not a problem   we’ve got a photo of him  the last year  i think  he was     it must have been the last year he was alive  it was a hot day  he was in the garden  in his little trunks  he was a wizened little man by then  white chest hair  jet black wig still  died in it  buried in it  he’s wearing it now  a little skeleton with jet black hair  like posh spice for eternity  but i knew that was gonna happen  i knew i would get old and fat and  ill and blind and deaf and  shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket  you’re ready  because you’re warned  you know about getting old  what they don’t talk about  so you’re not prepared  and it was a shock to me  i only found out recently  i’ll share it with you now  the distending testicles  see  you don’t know about it  but it happens in your fifties  i wasn’t checking them or anything  i didn’t see ’em for    years  as a young man  they were pert  and now they’re like two plums in a sock  i don’t know when it happened  but it was recently  they just  and this is how i found out  so  as i’ve been getting older  and they’ve been secretly stretching away  as i’ve got older  i’ve got richer  so my baths have been getting more luxurious  last year  i moved into a new house in hampstead  big bath  big sunken bath  south facing windows  i was in there the first night  lovely bath  sun streaming in  classical music  this is the life  i looked down  and they’re floating  right  now  i’d never dreamt that testicles would float  they seem like they’d be heavy  you could tie things down with them  and they’d sink  you know  most people never see their  in the sea  you’re in trunks  in the shower  they dangle  and baths aren’t usually that deep  that was my first thought   oh  my god  i never thought testicles would float   then my second thought kicked in   hold on  this bath’s two feet deep   right  i’m sitting on the bottom  they’re on top  what’s going on  right  and  i looked  and my testicles are now longer than my penis  easily  by some way  right  in fact  they’d created  a little  fleshy sort of life raft  right  my penis was dry  just nestled  just  floating on top  like that  like that  just bouncing around  i should have given it a little whistle  i’m just thinking   this is bizarre   fucking hell  right  and  i thought   maybe it’s a fluke   so i held them under the water for a minute  i let them go and they bobbed up  they’re really  they’re really buoyant  right  try it when you get home  if you’re in your   s  and a man  obviously  or caitlyn jenner  but  but the world is getting worse  and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media  because twitter and facebook  that’s where this ridiculous notion bred  and became stable  that it was more important to be popular than right  everything was  like me    agree with me   it falls into two tribes   i don’t agree with them  so i block them   and now  in this post truth era  people don’t care about the argument  they say   who’s saying the argument  no  they’re not on our side   it’s ludicrous  okay  and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had  my opinion is worth as much as yours  now  it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact  which is nonsense  i get tweets from people saying   i believe the earth is       years old    i believe you’re a fucking idiot   you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth  you can have opinions  but not your own facts  but it was all about being popular  right  and even politicians picked up those symptoms  politicians tweet now  they want to be popular  we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck  they didn’t want to make a mistake  and there’s a ridiculous thing of   let’s ask the average person what they think   let’s stop asking the average person what they  do you know how fucking stupid the average person is  we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say  do not drink   right  let’s take those labels off  right  for two years  and then have a referendum  but it’s not just politicians  even real news  the news on tv says things like   tweet us your news   don’t let them tweet you the news    i saw a tyrannosaurus rex    you liar  right  there was a big news story last year  about a train crash that happened a year before  and there was an inquiry  the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news  he said   we’ve looked at everything  and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor  so we’re going to slow them down a bit  statistically  this shouldn’t happen again   that would have been it  but the guy went   we asked the public what they thought   then there was three banal vox pops  first one said   i already pay      a year  so i’m not happy   the next one said   it takes me    minutes each way  it’s not good enough   the last one said   i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead   why is that on the news  and when is that applicable in any situation  all right  ted  you’re in early  ted  oh  ted  we’ve been through this  remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead  but  the big enemy is stupidity  right  i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got  now  admittedly  when i first got on twitter  i pushed my agenda  i was an outspoken atheist  not to change anyone’s opinions  i thought it was important to tell the other side  there are still    countries where people are put to death for being an atheist  i just wanted to say   it’s fine to be an atheist  it’s fine to believe in god  and it’s fine not to   that’s all i was saying  i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism  i could tweet a fact  and that annoyed just the right people  i’d tweet things like  happy birthday  earth  four point six billion years old today   someone would always go   we know what you’re fucking doing   this is a tweet i got after one of those  and  it was all in capitals  which excited me  that’s the sign of twitter madness  mixed with anger  it’s great  right  i looked at his profile  sure enough  he’s a gentleman from texas  he’s a fundamentalist  creationist christian  which is fine  he loves god  he loves god and  fetuses  mainly  he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay  and then he’s  remember it’s in capitals  he’s shouting at me  best tweet ever   your science   my science  right  science  by the way  is spelled s c i e n t s  already good  isn’t it  i mean  he’s obviously heard the word  he took a guess  never seen it written down  because it’s not in the bible  so he’s   your scients won’t help you  well  it will  it’s helping him  beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me   your scients won’t help you when satan   of course he believes in satan  why not  he believes that god made the universe in six days  you’re not gonna say to him   do you believe in satan   and have him say   bit far fetched   why doesn’t god kill satan  that’s  what i’d ask him  if i was wrong and i met god  i’d go   oh  you do exist   he’d go   yeah   i’d go   i’ve got a few fucking questions  mate  the first one would be   why did you make chocolate kill dogs   mental  right  also  if you hate homosexuality so much  why did you put the male g spot up the arse  what  what is wrong with you  then i’d say   why don’t you kill satan   and he’d go   what   i’d go   why don’t you kill satan  if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff  which you want  i mean  you do want    yes  yeah    you could kill him if you wanted  you can do anything  easy    yeah    why don’t you kill him  then    because  shut up    your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass   and he’s got a point  because if i die  and i find myself in hell  being raped by satan  science has pretty much let me down  but it’s this last line that he just throws away  the line he signs off with  makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received   your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass  i’ll be laughing   so  he’s there too  he’s  so  he’s a fundamentalist  christian  who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments  he dies  he wakes up in hell  right  which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma   oh  my god  i’m in hell  oh  my god  why have you forsaken me  i’m gonna be tortured for eternity   he sees me getting raped and goes   ha  ha  ha   he’s suddenly over it  is he  his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter  and like he’s not next  right  so i’m getting raped  right  by the devil  right  he’s just there   you fucking atheist scum   and i’m like that   yeah  whatever   i assume it happens all eternity   yeah  yeah  whatever   like that  i might say   watch your hooves on my testicles   and he’d go   why are they so distended   and i go   oh  like you’re brad pitt   you know what i mean  sorry  are we talking or raping  can we   you lying  fucking atheist   he’s probably bored   fucking atheists  every fucking day   right  his little gargoyle comes up   satan   he goes   what   and i go   yeah  what   he goes   there’s a fundamentalist christian    fuck this   he’d be on him like a ton of bricks  so  i got that tweet  i loved it  all i did was re tweet  right  and just watch the fun  people piling on  going   ah  loser   and he’s fighting back  really witlessly  saying things like   go fuck your sister  you english faggot   that makes no sense at all  i forgot about it  went and did something else  few hours later  on twitter again  it’s still all going off  right  it’s really funny  i’m laughing at all the replies  people saying things to him  i’m scrolling down  there’s one tweet  directly to me  from this woman  she says   you find rape funny   no  no  what  no   your mates find rape funny   no  listen  right   you find rape funny   listen  everyone  listen  right  no  i said to her   i didn’t tweet that    she went   you retweeted it    to show he’s an idiot   but you must find it funny or amusing  it’s not a frivolous thing   i said   no  well  it’s up to him  isn’t it  he can do it   now i’m arguing with quite a nice  sane person  who thinks this is mental  but i’m fighting for his right  to fantasize about me being raped by the devil  because i’m so conscious of  freedom of speech   what a topsy turvy world  right  although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit  because she did that thing that people do  she didn’t say   what  you find jokes about rape funny   she said   what  you find rape funny   the answer to that is  no  of course not  no one finds rape funny  not even rapists find rape funny  know what i mean  noone ever gives evidence saying   it was dark  he wore a ski mask  and he was giggling   that’s never  so  i sent back   you mean jokes about rape   she said   yes    i went   depends on the joke     it fucking doesn’t   i’m going   no  it does  it does  it depends on the joke  it’s about context  it’s about content  what do you mean by a rape joke   she said   even a joke with the word  rape’ in it is unacceptable   i said   that’s ridiculous  it depends what the joke is   i tweeted that clip of me in the office  going   i think there’s been a rape up there   everyone gets that because of the context  and the target is a middle aged man  who’s so narcissistic  he’ll say anything to win a silly game  you have to understand the joke and where it comes from  i said   some jokes don’t punch up or down  they don’t punch anywhere  they can just be a pun  a play on words  that don’t really mean anything   a joke went round when i was a kid  even adults told it  i’ll tell you  a woman goes running into a police station  she says   help  i’ve been graped   the policeman says   do you mean raped   she says   no  there was a bunch of them   that is a rape joke  right  so   and i even said to her   no  i agree  in most cases  yeah  real rape jokes  they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target  disgusting  i’d never tell those  but it depends on the joke  not the word or the subject   i calmed it down  and they agreed some jokes are worse than others  she ended it by saying   well  okay  i see your point  but  still  i will laugh at a joke with the word  rape’ in it  when no one in the audience has been raped   i should have left it  i just sent back   what a weird door policy   you turn up to a comedy gig  pay your money  someone says   can i just ask you a question   yeah  have you ever been raped  i have  yes  you can’t come in  what  why  a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in  off you go  that’s what the world is like  people take everything personally  they think the world revolves around them  particularly on twitter  i’m not tweeting anyone  i’m just tweeting  i don’t know who’s following me  i’ve got    million followers  they can be following me without me knowing  choose to read my tweet  and then take that personally  that’s like going into a town square  seeing a big noticeboard saying  guitar lessons   and you go   but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons   what’s this  there’s a number here  right  call that  are you giving guitar lessons  i don’t fucking want any  fine  it’s not for you  then  just walk away  don’t worry about it  i should say one thing in twitter’s defense  i use it as a marketing tool and for fun  like everyone else  but one great thing about twitter  for me  personally  i’m very into anti animal cruelty  years ago  it would take ages to get         signatures on a petition  standing outside tesco’s or something  that’s the magic number  because then it gets heard in parliament  i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got         signatures in days  and the law has been changed  thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty  it makes a difference  thank you  but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty  you think no one’s gonna argue with that  yes  they will  they just wanna be heard  i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment  i say   ban bullfighting   someone always says   what about the kids in syria   what  well  i’m not giving you a choice  you can do both  i’m not saying   throw that kid back in the hole  there’s a bull here   and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head  but it exists  so we have to deal with it now that i found out  through twitter  there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival  in china  every year  and it’s horrendous  and we send people with money to buy the dogs  to bring them back  it’s a drop in the ocean  they eat thousands over this weekend  i tweet the details  the petition  people don’t really read it  it’s a knee jerk  people say   racist   i go   what   they go   we eat pigs and cows in the west   yep  we do  i don’t but  yeah  i used to  you’re right  a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog  it’s not about the species  it’s what they do to these poor dogs  what they do is torture the dogs first   cause they think it makes the meat taste better  they beat them  they blowtorch them  they even skin them alive  and i saw this picture  on twitter of the opening of this ceremony  these two guys  in this chinese square  and they’re skinning this dog alive  it’s screaming  they’re laughing  it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen  i thought   i’ve got to tweet that   i tweeted the picture  with a petition  and i just said   one beautiful creature  and two ugly cunts  skinning it alive   right  and it took off  loads of retweets  it made the press  i got one tweet back  from a woman  that said   is that language necessary   i should have left it  right  but i was  i was incensed  i said   you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death   she said   i just hate the c word   i definitely should have left it  i sent back   people who hate the c word would hear it a lot less  if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts   thank you  you’ve been fantastic  good night  cheers  thank you so much  thank you so much  i hope you enjoyed the show  i hope no one was offended  no  i really do  that’s not the point  i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things  without being bad people  i think it’s my upbringing  i grew up  in poverty  with nothing  but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh  that was the men  the women carried on working  it was my older brother  bob  it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes  right in the bad situation  as things were happening  people were laughing  i realized   he’s healing them   that’s what comedy’s for  what humor’s for  it gets us over bad stuff  right  typical bob story  he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island  just asking the cashier how much everything was  just to see if he could break this poor man’s will  bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority  the first authority you come across are your parents  and he’d get in trouble  he got sent to bed  but i thought he’d won the argument  and he’d tease my mum  my mum was a typical working class woman  as i say  we lived in a shitty area  right  and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud  and a stolen bike  and fence posts missing  she mended the fence  turfed the garden herself  painted the step  she thought   if it looked respectable  we’d be respectable   it was about reputation  i guess  bob would send her postcards that just read   is that pedophile postman still reading your mail   and she’d take it  she’d go in  and she’d be horrified  she’d call bob   he saw it this time  you must stop doing that   even at her funeral  my mum died first  and my dad carried on for a year or so  just drinking beer  then he went  at mum’s funeral  we had different duties  i did catering and flowers  bob went to see the local vicar  that was a mistake  right  we’d never been to church  he didn’t know us  we didn’t know him  so  he said to bob   tell me about your mum  so i can say a few words   bob saw that as an opportunity  right  so  bob  with a straight face  said   well  she was a keen racist   the vicar went   i can’t say that   bob said   okay  put she liked gardening   he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church  he didn’t warn us  and he did get something by the vicar  so we’re called ricky  robert  bob  ricky  robert  marsha and larry  now  larry is the oldest  in his seventies  born in the war  i always thought he was the sensible one  first born  weight of the world on his shoulders  my mum said  when he was a teenager  he got a job and gave her the money to help out  he’s a stand up guy  larry  so  bob  gives the vicar the wrong name  didn’t warn us  we’re all in church  start of the funeral  we’re all there  packed out  the coffin comes down  guided by the vicar  the vicar goes to his pulpit  all confident  with his little notes  right  and he goes  eva leaves behind four loving children  ricky  robert  marsha  and barry  and  we snort like that  right  bob’s going  everyone realizes  we’re all laughing  we see larry go  all right  and the church is like  every time we thought of it  we’d see larry go  like that  right  then we’d just start giggling  just fits of fucking giggles  right  larry eventually started doing this  and the vicar’s thinking   what have i said   right  he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again  things that were just lies  or slightly wrong  my nieces and nephews started crying  i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues  they’d take one and hand it on  before the funeral  i’d taken the tissues out  written on them  folded them back and put them in  and each tissue said   snivelling fucking bitch   and they’re sort of laughing  so it was like a madhouse  right  everything the vicar said or did  we all started fucking laughing  right  and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit  he ended the funeral  and he made a beeline for me and bob  he said   sorry  was that okay   me and bob went   fucking brilliant  mate  it was fucking brilliant   that’s what i mean  we’re all gonna die  so we should have a laugh  if you can laugh in the face of adversity  you’re bullet proof  me and my brother  bob  had one simple rule  and that was if you think of something funny  you’ve got to say it  win  lose or draw  it might go well  it might go badly  but you’ve gotta say it  and bear that in mind  as i leave you with this  right  so  we’re all in the car one day  bob’s driving  packed in this car  a little day trip to the beach  we get stopped for a security check  and there’s a british bobby there  and he stops the car  bob’s at the window  he said   where are we off to   bob went   bognor   he went   can you just pop the boot  please   so he looks at that  looks in the boot  like that  back to bob’s window  gets that mirror on a stick thing  and he starts just looking under the car  and as he does that  his helmet falls off  right  and out of the helmet falls a packet of    cigarettes  and the copper went   bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets   and bob went   i knew it wasn’t fucking brains   you’ve been amazing  good night

       "      <td>ladies and gentlemen  jim jefferies    hello  boston  how you doing  thank you for that  thank you for that  you all getting fucked up   i’m not drinking  i got water   i can’t drink like i used to drink  okay   aww  i used to drink  i used to be a daily drinker  i used to be five drinks  every day  seven days a week  which is    drinks a week  which the fda of america says that means i’m an alcoholic  they say anything over    drinks makes you an alcoholic  bullshit   that’s less than three drinks a fucking day  that’s a reasonable amount of fucking drinking  you can have three drinks a day  there’s nothing wrong with that  you don’t have a problem   two lines of coke a day isn’t a coke problem   it isn’t a coke problem  that’s less than a gram a week   you know why i stopped drinking so much is because i cracked open a beer  and my son  he was five at the time  he looked up at me  he went   daddy  are you drinking again    i’m like   where the fuck did that come from  you little     like  very clearly it was from the woman who i gave a house to  but i was like   so  i don’t  i don’t drink  i don’t drink like that anymore  i don’t drink  ’cause i’m a good dad  you know  so  what i do now is i just drink one day a week  but i still get my    in   that’s how society has pushed me   that’s why if you ever see  like  a woman and she’s like in her mid thirties and it’s      p m  and she’s all dolled up  but it’s like she’s holding her shoes and just stumbling around and vomiting in alleyways  don’t feel sorry for her  she’s just a good mom   found a window of fucking time   the queen of england drinks four cocktails a day  that’s eight standard drinks a day  that means she’s a full blown fucking alkie  full blown   my question is  is she a nice drunk or a fucking nasty drunk  around cocktail three  does she start trawling the palace  just    philip   philip   and philip’s like   ah  fuck  lizzie’s at it again   get my land rover ready    she’s just trawling around   philip    she goes into one room  she jumps back out with a crown on her head   ha ha   i look like the money    i got to tell you a story right now  to tell this story  i have to start off by saying that i’m lactose intolerant   that means that i will not  tolerate lactose   if i eat lactose     minutes later  and you can set your fucking watch by it   i will shit myself   that sounds like more than just intolerance  doesn’t it   i shit myself   like  think about it right now  so  you’re all in groups  right  you’ve probably got groups of three  four friends you’re all hanging out with  and then you have your periphery groups  like  some cunt in your group has brought some friends from work  right  and there’s always one cunt in that fucking group where you  like  you turn to one of your good friends and you go   can’t tolerate that guy  can’t tolerate him   but it’s not like  if he comes near you   you shit yourself   so  my two biggest nemesisises  nemesi     n  the two things that  that i’m not good with   are ice cream and cheese  now  here’s the tragedy that is my life  ice cream and cheese are also my two favorite things   see  i wasn’t always lactose intolerant  no  it happened to me at     i’m    now  it happened on my   th birthday  i was sitting down  having my baskin robbins ice cream cake  as i always request  i’m hoeing into it  and then god looked at me and went   how’s all those atheist jokes going  cunt   pew     so now i can’t eat ice cream and cheese  right  but here’s the thing  i still eat ice cream and cheese   with the full knowledge that i’m going to shit myself  i still fucking do it  right  i  i  actually  what i do is if i have a heavy meal  i eat a scoop of ice cream afterwards ’cause then i know i’ll shit everything out  cause   i’m a genius  you see  that’s the jefferies diet  you can fucking take that home with you   so  i still eat ice cream and cheese  but i don’t eat them out in the wild   you’ll never see me on a boardwalk with an ice cream cone  no  no  no  i eat them at home  amongst people who love me and respect me  where i know where the toilet is  i know how much toilet paper we’ve got  i’m ready to fucking go   so  although i am intolerant of lactose  i still  you could argue  tolerate it   in the same way that my dad  doesn’t hate gay people   he’s just intolerant of them   my father’s a    year old man from rural australia  and when we were growing up  i heard him say the occasional homophobic slur  when he was young  uh  being gay was a mental illness  he’s a product of his environment  but two years ago  australia had a referendum  where they voted on gay marriage  and my father voted  yes   and that’s because i spent time talking to him  going   dad  it’s the right thing   and then my dad said   well  i guess they deserve to be as miserable as the rest of us    now  because my father has done this one forward thinking thing in his entire life  my dad now thinks he is woke as fuck   and my dad says sentences like this   i’ve got no problems with the gays  they can do whatever they want  in their own homes  behind closed doors  as long as they don’t try to involve me    and i’m always like   dad  are they trying to involve you    is there a scenario    where there’s two gay fellas in the inner suburbs of sydney  one’s strapped up to a bed with a fucking gag ball in his mouth  the other one’s lubing up his fist  and he’s about to enter  and just as he’s about to go in  this fella goes   and he goes   what’s that  mate    maybe we should try to involve gary jefferies     oh  that’s a brilliant idea  why didn’t i think of that   he unstraps him  they get in their honda civic  and they fucking drive   it’s a friday night in sydney  it’s raining  you’ve got to get around the harbor  it’s fucking  traffic’s horrendous  it takes them an hour     they get out to the house where my dad lives  my dad’s just sitting there  watching rugby league   he hears a knock on the door     that’s the second time this month   i told you not to involve me    now  i was  uh  touring in sydney earlier this year  and i did that routine  my father was in the audience  and he’d brought along all of his bowling friends  my father plays lawn bowls  uh  every day  uh  which is like  uh  curling but with a ball and  you’ll figure it out  anyway  so he brought these  like  eight mates  and all of his mates were aged between    and     right  all these blokes fucking went along  and then my dad came backstage  they’re all sinking piss backstage  my dad comes up to me and goes   yeah  i enjoyed the show  yeah  it was a good show  good show  different jokes you’re doing now  uh  i didn’t like that bit about me and the two gay fellas  i didn’t    and i didn’t understand why  and it turned out the reason he was upset  not because i spoke about him maybe having sex with two men  but because his friends found out that he voted  yes  for gay marriage   and now  and now all of his mates take the piss out of him  right  every time they go to do their shoelaces  they’re like   will you marry me  gary    that’s the thing about my dad  man  he’s trying  at his age  he’s still trying to be progressive and all that type of stuff  and here’s the problem  with young people  right  so  so  he’s backstage  he’s having a few beers  he’s voted yes for gay marriage  everyone’s teasing him a bit  and then my dad  at     says   oh  yeah  i’m good with the gays  i like the gays   and then he goes   i don’t know about those trans people   and then a person i know started going   well  you’re transphobic  you’re transphobic   and i was like   all right  everyone settle the fuck down   settle down   and i said   this guy just got used to gay people yesterday   let him have his fucking victory lap  you’re going to scare him off  you cunt    like  let him be old  you cunt  he goes like this   gay people are okay   and then you go   chicks with dicks   and he’s like   fuck off    this is the thing about being progressive and being woke and all that fucking bullshit  right  the the the young generations  the millennials  what you’re missing out on is  let old people be fucking old  right  they’ll be dead soon enough  right  stop fucking making everyone move as fast as you’re fucking moving  all right  people are trying  right  here’s the thing about millennials  you’re the worst people that have ever lived    you’re the worst  you’re just a horrible breed of people  and i don’t even blame you  it’s just the society you’re in  you have social media  every single peanut fucking thought that ever came into your head   i’ll fucking comment    what type of fucking low rent cunts are you   like  if you take more than three selfies a week  fucking end it  end it    all right   the idea that you think taking a photo of yourself  isn’t there something mentally wrong with that  and it’s not just  that’s  that’s bad  that’s bad as it is  but the fact that when you take that photo  your next thought is   other people might want to see this    you’re the fucking worst  i  i’ve tried dating you people  it’s a fucking nightmare  right  i don’t care how smooth your fucking skin is  i’ll take an old person with a better fucking attitude  you pricks    you know  you date a millennial  i used to have nice outings  you used to go to a beach  and you’d watch the sunset  no  fuck that  sunsets are ruined because you cunts all want to do yoga poses while i stand back here  going   did i do a good photo    heaven forbid i walk past a wall where someone’s painted some fucking wings on  that’s my whole day fucking ruined   see  here’s the thing about you  you are  the most progressive generation that’s ever been  that is true  you are the most progressive generation that’s ever been  but here’s something for you  every generation before you has also been the most progressive generation that’s ever been  you’re not fucking special    yeah  one day  and you don’t even see it coming  in about    years’ time  you’re gonna be the old bigots   you don’t see it coming  do you  you’ll be the old bigots  you’ll be standing around with your friends  going   i don’t understand the kids today  when i was young  women had penises and men had vaginas  and it was all very normal   but my grandson says he identifies as an asian woman who wants to be a black man and marry a fucking robot  and i’m not having it    so my point is  i can’t eat cheese   so   i can’t  i can’t  it’s not good for me  so  so  i i went on a date with this girl  i went maybe six or seven dates with her  and i took her out to one of those tasting menu restaurants  you know  those fancy restaurants  michelin star thing  where there’s  like     or    courses  this is a good move  for any young fella out there who wants to take a girl out  take them to a tasting menu  because if you’re like me  i eat my food too quick  and then i’ve got to sit there and watch them try to  you know  then i think   how much of that am i gonna get to eat   you know  and if you go to a tasting menu  the brilliant thing about going to a fancy restaurant is that the conversation never stops  because there’s so many courses that you can go   i liked that course  i didn’t like course number three  but i enjoyed seven  so i wonder what’s up next   it’s a good way of keeping things going    now  i tried to do  i tried to do this routine in kansas  very hard to explain    what a really good meal’s like  they fucking  they couldn’t wrap their brain around it  i was like   you know when you go to one of those really fancy restaurants    and i went   think about the best meal you’ve ever had   and then one guy yells out   ribs   and i was like   yeah  yeah  ribs are good   but think of a meal that’s even better than ribs   and he thought about it and he went   two ribs   and i went   yeah    so these restaurants  they’re pretentious as fuck  right  every  every dish includes a foam  a reduction  and a mousse  and there’s always a quail’s egg and a truffle  always with a quail’s egg  why can’t they use a fucking chicken egg   every time i go to the supermarket  i always go to the poultry  i’m never like   oh  quail or chicken  what will we eat tonight   where the fuck are they buying all the quails’ eggs   and come to think of it  i’m not sure  if i’ve ever seen a quail   i’ve never been out and gone   ah  fuck me  the quails are out tonight   better get the car in the garage  don’t want it covered in quail shit  fucking quails   so it’s always a reduction  a mousse  and a foam  next to a quail’s egg with a truffle on top  and the first course is always called the amuse bouche  the amuse bouche is never on the menu  and what this is in fancy food is you eat that  and that’s meant to make you realize what the rest of the meal might be like  it’s to make you go   oh  we’re eating  oh   i get what’s going on  this is a small portion of bigger things   it’s like if before you came to the show  you all went to a smaller comedy club tonight and watched someone do a five minute set  so you could go   i get what jim’s gonna do    and there’s always some french cunt who’s the waiter   i can say this on netflix  the french are a bunch of cunts  i’m not sure if   are you even watching it   on your french netflix    anyway  so there’s always a french fuck   he walks out  and the first course is always served on  like  a ceramic white spoon  with the reduction  the mousse  and the foam  and the quail’s egg  and something on top  and he walks up to you  and he’s very patronizing  and he goes   okay  now it’s time for the amuse bouche   and then he goes   the chef has prepared this for you   and you always  you always nod along  like   oh  that’s good  the chef   when you really should just be an asshole to him and just go   the chef  you say   did you hear that  honey  the chef’s doing the cooking today   i thought the busboy had just fucking stepped it up a gear  but fuck me  i think we’re in for a treat    and then he has the audacity to tell you how to eat it  he goes   uh  the chef recommends that you put the spoon in your mouth and you eat it all in one bite  and let the quail’s egg explode over the foam  the mousse  and the reduction  and then you swallow    all right   when you should really go   thank fuck you came along  cunt   i wouldn’t have known what to do   a spoon  you say  a spoon  i would’ve     so then you go through that  then you get a couple more courses  then there’s always a course that involves something  the ingredients they use aren’t the ingredients that you want to fucking eat  right  if you were to buy a pork product in a supermarket and you were spending money  it would be  like  a pork loin or a chop  right  in these restaurants  it’s always like   this is the kidney of the thing and the fingernail of the hoof  and  and you are getting the rind from the pig’s eye  the eye socket of the pig   and you’re like   oh  i haven’t got enough socket in my fucking diet   at the end you’re like   i’m eating bone marrow  i didn’t know what a bone marrow fan i fucking am   and it’s all shit  it’s all fucking bad for you   i always  i always feel fatter after  this is the deal  right  i’m recording a special right now  so i’ve dropped  like  seven pounds in a week  by just not fucking eating  just not fucking eating  and  i come from a long line of fat people  right  i come from fat people  the reason i  i lose weight is because of you  the general public  and your comments on the internet   without you and your words of wisdom  i’d be a fat fuck  but thank god you all come along  and you fucking bully the fuck out of me   see  i’m not  i’m not for fat shaming  but i kind of am  i kind of am   i’m not for any shaming  really  but i don’t know why we’ve gotten to this moment in society where fat people are immune to being shamed  yet every other addiction in our society is shamed  i watched my mother eat herself to death  i fucking watched it  she hid food  she fucking kept on eating  she denied what she was doing  and she fucking died from it  right  i watched it happen  but for some reason  we have to look at fat people and go   you be your best self  you’re looking great   every other fucking addiction in our society  we shame  you smoke a cigarette  you don’t think smokers feel shame  you don’t think smokers are breathing fucking smoke into their lungs  going   i’m a piece of shit  i’m a parent  what the fuck am i doing with my life   we don’t need you to go   you smell   you’re killing yourself  go outside   there’s a section for people like you    like fucking cocaine addicts  you don’t think they feel shame  every time a cocaine addict has a line  they literally have to look at themselves in the fucking mirror   you don’t compliment a fucking meth addict who’s picking scabs off their face  like   you be you   you’re living your best life   no  but eating  we have to watch people get fat as fuck and compliment them  fuck off  should be the same as smoking  a fat cunt comes into a doughnut store  the person behind the counter should be able to go   you’re gonna have to eat that outside    they’ll go outside with their doughnut  aww  and they’ll have a little roped off section  let’s make it small  give them a fucking incentive   they can stand out there with the other fatties and look at each other and go   oh     do you remember when we were allowed to eat on planes    so  anyway  then we go on through the menu  course number five  now  these fancy restaurants always have a foie gras course  foie gras  it’s fucking delicious  i didn’t know what it was for years  i just enjoyed it  it’s this buttery  fucking fleshy thing  it’s delicious  and then someone showed me a video  do you know how they make foie gras  they get a goose  then they step on its fucking feet  and then they pull the goose’s neck up  like this  and they get what’s called a foie gras funnel  which is like a funnel with a big  long tube  and they shove it down the goose’s throat until the goose looks like a fucking sword swallower   and then they force feed the goose grains  day and night  right  and then after that  they wire the goose’s mouth shut so it can’t vomit the food back up  because of doing this  the goose gets cirrhosis of the liver  and the liver gets fat and yellow  and that’s what gives it that buttery taste   my big question is    who was the first cunt to figure that out   who  who was the first bloke just to walk up to his mates and just go   hey  guys   i was torturing geese    as i always do    and you would not believe the delicious side effects    now  i don’t believe in animal cruelty  uh  but  but who here  uh  thinks that we should no longer test on animals   all right  they’re what we call fucking idiots   if you’re a fucking moron who just applauded   there should be no animal testing   you fucking basic cunt   now  i don’t think we should test on animals for something as frivolous as makeup  but when it comes to medicine  what’s our fucking other option  let’s just think of something really simple  like acne cream  right  you can’t just get a cucumber    smear the cream on the cucumber and go   no change to cucumber   ready for people    no  you’ve got to start with a mouse  don’t you  smear it on the mouse  that mouse dissolves    first cream not good    then you get another cream  that mouse fucking multiplies like a mogwai hit with water    better    than first cream   still  not good    then you get one where it works  then you go   that one’s good   then you get a rat  then you get a rabbit  then you get a cat  then you get a dog  then you get a primate  then you get a homeless person  a student  then us   and that’s how we have the medicine   so moving on  we go to fucking course number six  the waiter brings up a cart  this thing has a dome on the top  and he rocks up with this fucking thing with the dome  he carried all the other food  but this thing needs a trolley   and he pulls it off and there’s all these cheeses there  and he goes   your next course is the fromage   like that  the fro  actually  i don’t like that  i don’t like that the cunt called it fromage   i know it’s a little thing  but it bothers me  he was just doing it to frenchie the fucking experience up   he could’ve said  cheese   he knows the fucking word’s cheese  everything else he said in english  and then he had to say fucking fromage  fuck that cunt   you’re telling me  you’re telling me that he’s  uh  he’s learned the entire english language but he’s just one word short   i don’t like that  i’ll be honest with you here  and this is being recorded  and i’m happy to say this to the whole world  my most hated group in society  is italian americans    and  and  and  look  this is a comedy show  so if there are any italian americans in the room with us this evening  please know that you’re not welcome    you’re a fucking painful bunch of people   pick a fucking accent  either go italian or go american  but don’t flip flop   you’ll be in an italian restaurant  the waiter will seem normal  and then he’ll fucking change  right  you’ll be in an italian restaurant  the guy will go   hey  enjoying your meal  it’s good  right  my mother  she used to make it with the mozzarell   and you’re like    what the fuck happened to that word  cunt   you  it’s like he had a fucking stroke in the middle of the fucking word  mozzarell  fuck you   that’s why i got to give it up for the asians  i like the asians   they pick an accent  and they fucking stick to it   the asians either go full asian  or they go full american  they don’t go back and forth   you’ll never be in an asian restaurant and have the waiter walk up and go   hey  you enjoyed that  you should try it with some soy soy   no  they never do that   so kudos  asians  kudos   anyway  so he rocks up with his fucking cart of cheese  there’s some soft cheeses there  some camemberts and bries and whatnot  the most dangerous cheeses of them all   and i look at the cheese  and now  this  this girl  she does not know of my condition   and i look at the cheeses  i look up at him  and i went   how long    is the rest of the meal    and he said   uh  maybe  uh     minutes   i went   twenty minutes  i’ve got a    minute drive   fromage me    and i got myself a big plate of cheese  and i fucking caned that cunt  i fucking ate all that  we got another couple of courses  they have two dessert courses  one of the courses  the dessert courses  might as well have just been called  lactose    it was a lactose crumble  next to a lactose foam  with a lactose reduction  with a scoop of ice cream  then they freeze dried some lactose crumble table side and sprinkled it on top  and i looked at it  and i was like this   in for a penny  in for a pound    and i ate that bowl of lactose as well  now  what i didn’t mention is the girl i’m on the date with  she is a very petite girl  she had given up around course six   i had also eaten her plate of fromage   and her bowl of lactose   lactose is now coursing through my veins  i am on borrowed time   and so i’m sitting there  knowing  i’m just sort of like   all right  we’ll be good here  we’ll be good   you know  i’m listening to her   oh  that’s interesting    and then the waiter comes up and goes   would you like a coffee   and i went   no   just the check  please    so he gets me the check  now  we’re gonna go back to my place  now  i’d been on a few dates with this girl  we’d always gone back to her place  this time was the first night she was gonna come back to my house  i was happy about going back to my place ’cause i know where all the toilets are  i know the distance  there’s a lot of things that were going on there  and because she was staying at my place  she goes to me  she goes   oh  we have to stop at the pharmacy  because there’s a a a cream that i need  like a lotion type of thing   and i said   that you need    and i i i said  i said   are you sure you don’t want it    and she goes   no  i  no  i need it   and i said   i don’t know if you know the difference between wants and needs   like  if you need it  that means that you’ll die    if you don’t have it  so  do you need it    and she claimed to need it  so  we drove off to the pharmacy  we get in there  right  we walk in this rite aid  and there’s just this wall of fucking lotions and that type of stuff  and i thought she needed it so she would know which one to grab   but she’s just sort of looking at them  like this  right  and i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  box step     like this    and she can’t pick one  now  this is the thing  she has to get a lotion  i don’t understand what’s going on with the whole lotion thing with women  right  i  okay  i’ve lived with  uh  six girlfriends in my life   in my  in my life  i’ve lived with six women  and all six of them have left me   and sooner or later  i’m going to blame myself   but not today    now   now  every single woman i’ve ever lived with has a nighttime ritual  where they  see  i have a bedtime ritual  what i do is i go to the bathroom  i have a piss  i brush my teeth  i go to bed   i’ve recently figured out that i could do them at the same time   i have a piss and i brush my teeth  and i spit over  like that  now  but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for  like     minutes  and you close the door  and then you come out  and the last thing you do is you’re sort of  you’re rubbing something here   and then you go like this   and then you get into bed  and you tell me what i’ve done wrong that day    and that’s your little nighttime routine   now  i don’t know what goes on in that room   but i assume  i can’t be positive  but i assume you are covering your body head to toe in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence   now  i’m    years old  um  i i wear makeup for work  like  when i’m on tv  they put makeup on me  i never even wipe it off  i just fucking  they give me a towelette  and i go   ah  don’t worry about it   then   it goes away over a week  and they put it back on   apart from that  i i’ve worn sunscreen  but i’ve never put anything else on my face  nothing else my entire life  um  i’m arguably an alcoholic   i  i used to be a heavy smoker  i’ve been a cocaine addict    and my skin is fucking flawless    and you want to know why  because my skin learned at a very young age    that it couldn’t rely on me   my skin knew that i was not gonna help it  so it was like   all right  we’re going to have to produce our own oils if we’re gonna keep shit together   where women’s skin  women’s skin  every day  women’s skin is like this   i haven’t had my special cream    and that’s why you all age so horribly    yeah  i i don’t  i don’t do  as many misogynistic jokes as i used to  but i like to whip one in there every now and then   it’s funny because i didn’t  i used to do more back in the day  but what happened was  in our society  people started getting angry at me because they didn’t know i was joking  even though my job description would say    that i was possibly joking   so this is what happens now with comedians  for some reason  we’re enemy number one  every time we do a joke that you don’t like  you all go   why did you say that    why   i get asked at interviews   why would you say that joke   and you go   i thought it was going to be funny    it’s fucking ridiculous  i’m in trouble now for jokes that i did fucking ten years ago  people ring me up and go   you said this joke ten years ago   now  our job as comedians is  okay  if the line’s here  our job is to go right up to the line  that’s our fucking job  to take risks  to gamble  if you will  now  what happens when you gamble  you don’t always win   otherwise it wouldn’t be called fucking  gambling    so  what happens is we go all the way up to the line  right  which is fine  so  on my specials  i have jokes that have gotten through standards and practices and lawyers and everything  and still gotten on fucking netflix  and then you watch it years later  and you’re fucking angry  well  go fuck yourself  right  because   because  when i told the joke  the line was here  and it was socially acceptable  right  now you moved the line back to here  so i won’t go there anymore  i won’t  but the line’s here  but you can’t get angry because you moved the line and then the fucking joke was over here   and then  and then you have the audacity to ask me to maybe apologize for a fucking joke  here’s the thing  i wanted the joke to work  sometimes you tell a joke and it doesn’t fucking work  and then people go   why did you do that   you go   i tried to make the joke work  but it didn’t fucking work  and now you’re all upset with me    it’s like if a pilot smashes a plane into fucking the side of a mountain  you don’t go   why did you do that    he’ll go   my intention was to land the plane safely   but it turns out i failed at my job  but i didn’t  i didn’t wake up in the morning going   smash it     see  it’s like  i watched dave chappelle’s special  i watched his special  i thought it was fucking great   it was hilarious  and people got upset  and they got upset by different jokes in it  they get  see  here’s the thing  i didn’t enjoy every joke in his special  some of the things he said  i didn’t even agree with  but you know what happened  when i watched the jokes i didn’t enjoy  i got over it because i’m not a fucking pussy    all right  and i just listened to the ones i fucking enjoyed  see  he said that he thought that michael jackson didn’t fuck kids  eh   i think michael jackson did fuck kids   that’s how me and dave differ   a lot of people have stopped listening to michael jackson’s music  they go   i won’t listen to it anymore  i won’t listen to it anymore   i still listen to it   but i only listen to the jackson      cause if he was fucking kids back then  it was just experimenting  and there’s nothing wrong with that   i go all the way to  blame it on the boogie   and i fucking call it a day   so  look   what i’m trying to tell you is  she couldn’t pick which cream she wanted   and she’s looking at all the different creams  i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  box step   and i think to myself   fuck it  i’ve got to have a shit   now  there’s a bathroom in the back of the  uh  pharmacy  so i duck off  now  at this point of the story  i got to tell you  all right  that this girl’s a germophobe  it’s vital to the story that she’s a germophobe  now  we may have some people in the room who identify as germophobes and  to those people  go fuck yourself   i’ve  i’ve never met a person in my life who’s interesting who’s a fucking germophobe  you’re always boring cunts who tell us all the time that you’re a fucking germophobe  being a germophobe is doing a lot of heavy lifting for your shit fucking personality   how dare you act like we’re all diseased  every time we shake your hand  you go   i i can’t because  eh   every time you cook with a germophobe  you cook and put some scraps in the bin  you go   hey  can you take that out for the trash for me   and they’re like   i’d love to  but i can’t   because i’m a germophobe   and you’re like   the rest of us are loving it   you lick the bin   aah    you’re not special  while i’m at it  people with peanut allergies can fuck off an’ all   now  i’m not saying that there aren’t people with severe peanut allergies  there truly are  there’s people who will die if they eat a fucking peanut  what i’m saying is it’s your fucking problem   the rest of us don’t have to be involved  right  like  have you ever been on a plane lately  and they go like this  they go   uh  on today’s flight  we will not be serving peanuts  as there’s a person on the flight with a severe peanut allergy   and you’re like   all right  well  don’t give them to them  then    how fucking weak willed are these cunts   oh  i know it will kill me  but the salty goodness    like  what do they think the rest of us are going to fucking do  go to the air stewardess   uh  excuse me  uh  who has that peanut allergy     what do you think’s gonna happen if someone next to you eats a fucking peanut  do you think peanut particles will get in the fucking air  guess what  these flights fly back and forth and back and forth all fucking day  in between  they hardly clean the planes  do you think they’d go on with a special peanut  de peanut ing machine and fucking fill the fucking air   see  you know what i do  every time when i’m on a flight where they serve peanuts  what i do is i get six or seven peanuts  and i wedge them down the back of the fucking seat   and if someone ever dies  i’ll be the first person to say   i was wrong    now  i talked earlier about  like  how i did one misogynistic joke  and how  how  at the moment now  i i i don’t know if people know that i’m fucking joking  it’s become very odd now  this tension that we have about what’s right and what’s wrong  i was on a plane and this fucking  this woman was trying to put a bag in the overhead luggage  and she was shaking  and she can’t do it  and i went to help her  and she just looked at me and went   no  no   like that   and it’s  like  now i’m in trouble for trying to do a nice thing  that used to be my one move   i used to open doors  i used to lift bags  i used to stand up for pregnant people on buses  that was my fucking gig  that’s what i had going    and now  because i tried to help her  she’s  like  she’s  like  angry at me  like i’m trying to do a male patriarchy thing  where i can lift this better than you  so i just told her to fuck off   and  turns out  she’s just a woman with parkinson’s  and she did need my help   but that scenario could’ve been different is what i’m saying   like  i was in a movie  i was in a movie with my son  we were watching  a couple of years ago  we were watching the ghostbusters movie  the new one with the female cast  watching ghostbusters  my son  he’s four at the time  and he turns to me watching ghostbusters  and he goes   this movie’s not as good as the other ghostbusters   and i went   shut up  shh   you’re not allowed to say that  this movie’s every bit as good as the other ghostbusters  we’ll talk about it in the car    you know  and on reflection  that movie wasn’t as good   it was a shit fucking movie   wasn’t funny  the action sequences weren’t good  it was a fucking shit film  it wasn’t shit because women were in it  it was just shit because it was shit   you know what i mean  like  ’cause that cast  paul feig is the director  he directed bridesmaids  one of my top ten comedies  the rest of the cast was from that movie  they’d made good films together  this one was just a misfire  but the weird thing that happened was no one went to see that film  and then all of a sudden  men were pigs  men are fucking misogynistic assholes because that film didn’t do good  no  it didn’t do good because you women didn’t fucking see it either  if you went and saw the movie  if you went and saw the movie  it would have been a success  but you didn’t fucking see it  then you got angry at us for not fucking seeing it   do you want to know why it didn’t do well  it’s an action comedy  and if you go to any marketing company that talks about how they sell things  action comedies primarily are enjoyed by men  there might be exceptions to the rule  but primarily men like action comedies  do you want to know why  because we’re funny  and we do things  and   and  and women like dramas because you cause drama    so my point is  stop remaking our fucking movies  leave our movies alone  we don’t remake your films  you don’t see brad pitt and george clooney getting together to make mystic fucking pizza of the sisterhood of the ya ya fuckhead traveling pants movie   we leave your shit alone   although there should be some films that should be remade with  you know  different casts  like  one of my favorite movies from my childhood was  uh  nine to five  dolly parton  lily tomlin  jane fonda  fantastic  it still stands up today  it’s about three women  they have a boss who’s a fucking pig  like  it’s even poignant right now  they have a boss who’s a pig  so what they do is they drug him  and they put him in bondage gear  and they hang him from the roof of one of their garages for three weeks  it’s a fun film   you know  they should do that with a male cast  right  so  there’s a woman  you put her in the position of power   the three employees don’t like it  so they drug her  and they put her in bondage gear  and they hang her from the roof of one of their garages  it’s just a fun film   another movie that needs an opposite remake  brokeback mountain    that movie’s  it needs it   the original film is a couple of blokes  they’re working on the land  they ran out of conversation  so they went into a tent  and they fucked each other in the ass   my film  it’s a couple of young lasses  they’re working on the land  they’re doing a man’s job  they get bored  so they go into a tent  and they finger bang each other    my version doesn’t even need a tent   but one of the things that’s happening in cinema at the moment is  and i think we can all agree on this  okay  so  so we’re done with blackface people  stop doing that  people don’t like it  if if you’re getting ready for halloween and you think   i might do blackface   just don’t   it’s so much easier to not do blackface   like you don’t have to do anything  just save yourself time  see  the thing is  with actors now you’ve got in movies  i think we’ve all agreed that you can’t play outside your race  it goes back to  like  mickey rooney playing an asian character in breakfast at tiffany’s  don’t play outside your race  you can only play your race  i think we can all agree on that now  now  there’s another thing happening now  where the gays are getting upset if heterosexuals are playing gay people on film  i’m not sure about that  but i’m open to discussion  but here’s the thing that’s really fucking pissing me off  taron edgerton  or egerton  or whatever  he played elton john and eddie the eagle  two of the ugliest cunts that have ever lived   he’s really good looking  i don’t fucking like that   he’s playing uglyface  how many ugly actors would like that fucking opportunity   do the good looking people need fucking everything   like  charlize theron fucking gains    pounds  and all they say is   how brave    you know what’s brave  being ugly every single fucking day   so i decide to go off to the toilet  right  and i’m going off   and she goes   where are you going   and there’s no point lying anymore  so i just went like this   um  i have to shit myself    and she goes   if you take a shit in a public toilet  then i’ll never fuck you again   i was like     it’s a very good argument  that’s a  that’s what you call a quandary    so  i went   all right  but just fucking hurry up   so now i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  jog  i’m like   come on   pick a fucking cream  pick a cream  any cream  they’re all good  all of these creams are good   she’s not hurrying up  so i did what every man has done in a relationship  right  and there’s a few men in this room that probably did it this evening to get here on time  this is how you hurry up your wife or your girlfriend  every man does this  this is our special move  we go out  and we sit in the car   and we think   this’ll send a strong message    now  i assume women are like   ah  thank fuck he’s gone to sit in the car    so  i’m sitting in the car and i do this move  where i’ve leant like this  i leant all the way down  and i’m trying to breathe through it  like i’m in  like  a lamaze class  like    and the reason i’m sitting like this is because my theory is if i lay flat like this  the shit won’t come out as quickly  because of gravity  you see   if i sit upright  the shit has an easier way to fall   yeah  and also  sitting like this  i’m clenching my ass cheeks together   because if the shit gets past the sphincter  it won’t get past the impenetrable barrier that is me clenching my ass cheeks together  because i’m a fucking genius   and i’m sitting there  and i’m watching her through the window of the pharmacy   and she selects the cream  but then she stops a bit  right  then she goes back to get another cream  so i’ve got to hurry this up  so i start honking  just  honk  honk  she looks out like she’s really angry with me  then she’s going to the counter  i think   oh  good  she’s coming   then she just  like  bumps into a friend   starts fucking talking to someone  so  i thought   i’d better step this up a gear   so  i put the window down  and i lean my head out the window  and every time the sliding doors open like this    i went   i’m gonna shit myself   i’m gonna shit myself    now  i forget that i’m off the telly  i don’t think about it on a regular basis  right  so  i’m leaning out the window  yelling   i’m gonna shit myself   and this    year old kid skateboards by and goes   good luck with that  jim     so i’m sitting there yelling   i’m gonna shit myself   eventually she comes out  she gets in the car  and  like  obviously she’s upset  she has reason  i have been yelling   i’m going to shit myself   and honking the horn   she sits next to me and she goes   i cannot believe   and i went   no time to fight   this is not a drill    and i fucking fishtail out of the fucking car park  now i’m in ventura  and i’m whizzing through traffic  she’s holding on  fucking  the cream’s bouncing around  i see the golden arches  i see mcdonald’s  i turned to her  i said   could i please have a shit in the mcdonald’s   mcdonald’s are renowned for how clean they keep their toilets  i won’t even sit on the seat  i’ll just hover and spray    to that  i received a firm   no    so i have to make a decision  my house is five minutes away  her house is three minutes away  i i make a call  i’ve got to go to her house  it’s the only way i’ll make it  right  now  this  this kills me  every day i think about this  right  if i went to her house to begin with  i never would’ve had to stop to get the cream   so  anyway  we get into her house  we get in the driveway  she has a long driveway  i park the car  i get out  i’m already like this   come on    come on    she’s got the keys  so none of my running’s helping  she’s just fucking in heels  just going through her bag  i’m going   come on   now she’s stopped being angry  she just finds this hilarious   she’s just laughing  we get to the door  right  now  you know when you’ve really  you’ve  you really have needed to do a shit  it could be five minutes  it could be five hours  but there was an amount of time where you were desperate to do a shit  then you get to within    feet of the toilet   and your asshole starts to reward itself   for all the good work that you’ve put in   your asshole goes   yeah  we did it   we did it  we did it as a team  and that’s my favorite thing  that we did it together     cause you always get to the toilet  you always go   ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah   pooooooof   you never go  seat  poof  no  why is it that you always just made it  you’re not that lucky  there aren’t that many coincidences in the world    that you always just made it  it’s that your asshole has its own brain and a  like  pavlovian response  so anyway  i get up to the door  and i’m going   come on  come on  come on  come on  come on   and i’m  like  really yelling  she walks up  she gets the keys out  she’s laughing  she goes to put the keys in the door  she drops the keys      oh  the keys hit the ground  and i shit myself    and this isn’t just like a little warning squirt of  like   all right  there’s more where this came from   and it wasn’t like a full evacuation either  it wasn’t just like a full   pooof  like this  it was the weirdest thing  it was just shit coming out of me in a steady meter  just   no pushing   no pushing  everything from liquids to solids and everything in between   and i’d gone from being all  aaagh   to just a calmness    came over me  i was just   and my jeans are filling up   and instantly  the  the smell of human fecal matter has filled the air  and for the first time  she gets her ass into gear and she goes   oh  fuck   and she grabs the keys   and i went   oh  no  no  no  no  no   no point hurrying anymore   you take your time     all right  now  before i go  i’m gonna tell a very  very quick little story  um  my mother passed away a few months ago  and  um  when my mother died  look  my mother  uh was never  yeah  look  here’s the deal  my mother’s not a  wasn’t a funny woman  she had no  no sense of humor  never found me funny  she never watched anything that i did and went   that was funny   but she was always   she was always very supportive of me  and  you know  the only per  she was the only one in my life  the only one  that i bagged on my mother so much  i called her gunta  she was the butt of so many fucking jokes that i said  and i’ll give her this  she never complained  not fucking once  not once   so  i’d like to tell one story where she comes out of it a little bit cooler  right  now  when i was about    and my brother was about     we were home watching  uh  star wars  right  we were home watching star wars  i was on the throne of misery  my brother was on the couch  watching star wars  my brother scott  who’s a fucking nutjob  right  he turns to me and he goes   hey  jim  get me a coke   and i went   get your own fucking coke  i’m not gonna get you a coke   and he goes   get me a coke or i’ll piss on the carpet     what  what     get me a coke or i’ll piss on the carpet   i go   i’m not getting you a fucking coke   and he’s going   so you’d rather i just pissed on the carpet   i go   i guess that’s what i’m fucking telling you    and my brother walks to the middle of the living room  stands in front of me  gets out his cock  starts pissing on the carpet  and he looks at me and he goes   i don’t know why you constantly find the need to cause trouble   it would have been so easy for you just to get a coke  but  no  not jim  has to be difficult   then he shakes his cock  puts it away  goes back  lies down  now  this is the bit that fucking kills me   he doesn’t get a coke   so  i was sitting there  you know     degrees celsius  no air conditioning  fucking  a puddle of urine in the middle of the living room  just steaming upwards  now we’re onto about  we’re probably on return of the jedi by now  my mom comes in  and she does that thing that parents do when they have no words  she walks in  just to see the urine in the middle  and she went like this   why   who  who would  who would  why    and then she went   every fucking day it’s something different  every day    and then she went   who did this   and i didn’t want to get in trouble  so i went   scott did it   and she turned to scott and she goes   what did you do that for   and he went   i told jim to get me a coke  or i’d piss on the carpet    and my mother turns to me and goes     why didn’t you get him a coke

      from life is worth losing recorded on november          beacon theater  new york city  new york  it’s called the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it    people are fucking nuts  this country is full of nitwits and assholes  do you ever notice that  oh  my goodness  yes  oh  my goodness  yeah  nitwits  assholes  fuck ups  scumbags  jerk offs and dipshits  and they all vote  they all vote  yeah  in fact  sometimes you get the impression they’re the only ones who vote  you can usually tell who’s been doing the voting by looking at the fucking election returns  man  it sure ain’t me out there wasting my time with a meaningless activity like that  you know those people on the  jerry springer show   those are the average americans  oh  yeah  believe me  below average can’t get on the show  can’t get on  below average is sitting home watching that shit on tv  getting ready to out and vote  filling out their sample ballot  people are fucking dumb  you can say what you want about this country  and i love this place  i love the freedoms we used to have  i love it  i love that  i love it when it didn’t take a fucking catastrophe to get us to care for one another  i love the fact that we’re on camera all the time from all angles  but  you know  you can say what you want about america  and i say i love this place  i wouldn’t have it any other way  wouldn’t live in any other time in history in any other place  but say what you want about america  land of the free  home of the brave  we’ve got some dumb ass motherfuckers floating around this country  dumb ass motherfuckers  you know  now  obviously that doesn’t include this audience  i understand that  you seem intelligent and perceptive but the rest of them  holy jumping fucking shit balls  dumber than a second coat of paint  now  this ain’t just ranting and raving  this ain’t just blowing off steam  i got a little evidence to support my claim  it just seems to me seems to me  that only a really low iq population could have taken this beautiful continent  this magnificent american landscape that we inherited  well  actually  we stole it from the mexicans and the indians but  hey  it was nice when we stole it  it looked pretty good  it was pristine  paradise  have you seen it lately  have you taken a good look at it lately  it’s fucking embarrassing  only a nation of unenlightened half wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today  a shopping mall  a big  fucking shopping mall  you know that  that’s all you got  that’s all you got here  folks  mile after mile of mall after mall  many  many malls  major malls and mini malls  they put the mini malls in between the major malls  and in between the mini malls they put the mini marts  and in between the mini marts  you’ve got the car lots  gas stations  muffler shops  laundromats  cheap hotels  fast food joints  strip clubs and dirty bookstores  america the beautiful  one big transcontinental commercial cesspool  and how do the people feel about all this  how do the people feel about living in a coast to coast shopping mall  well  they think it’s just fucking dandy  they think it is as cool as can be  because americans love the mall  they love the mall  that’s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time  shopping and eating  millions of semiconscious americans day after day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating  especially eating  americans love to eat  they are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food  hot dogs  corn dogs  triple bacon cheeseburgers  deep fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheesewhiz  mayonnaise soaked barbecue  mozzarella patty melts  america will eat anything  anything  anything  shit if you were selling saut ed raccoons assholes on a stick  americans would buy them and eat them  especially if you dipped them in butter and put a little salsa on them  this country is big time pig time  forget the bald eagle  you know what the national emblem of this country ought to be  a big bowl of macaroni and cheese  a big bowl  because everything in this country is king size  king size  extra large and super jumbo  especially the fucking people  have you seen some of the people in this country  have you taken a good look at some of these big  fat motherfuckers walking around  big  fat motherfuckers  oh  my god  huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of interstate buses  the people in this country are immense  massive bellies  monstrous thighs and big  fat fucking asses  and if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them  you’ll look at one of them and you begin to wonder  how does this woman take a shit  how does she shit  and even more frightening  how does she wipe her ass  can she even locate her asshole  she must require assistance  are paramedics trained in this field  and standing right next to her  of course  with a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of pie is her clueless fucking husband joe six pack  with his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckle  this guy ain’t seen his dick since the nixon administration  and if you stand there and you look at the two of them  you begin to wonder to yourself  do these people fuck  is this man actually capable of fucking this woman  it doesn’t seem structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration  maybe they’re in that  cirque du soleil  or something  i’m telling you the people in this country   every one of them   is    pounds overweight  they are gargantuan  and in the summertime   god help us   in the summertime they will all want to wear short pants  jesus lord  protector of all that is good and holy  deliver us from fat people in short pants  they all got short pants  big bellies  fat thighs and dumb kids  short pants  big bellies  fat thighs and dumb kids  every one of them has got two dumbass kids with them  and the whole family is wearing t shirts  and every one of them has got the same t shirt   i’m with stupid   apparently in this country  the stupids are an extended family  and besides wearing them t shirts  everyone in the family has got on a backpack  they got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid shit  and the reason they got to carry their stupid shit strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold food  and to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting shit they ate that day  and  another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid shit  they ain’t got enough stupid shit at home  they just had a stupid shit sale  they’re gonna buy more  they’re going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big  fat  ugly  oversized suv that’s got plenty of room in it  plenty of room in it for stupid shit and lots of room left over for these big  fat  ugly motherfuckers to get them home  stopping on the way  of course  for jelly roll and fried dough  these people  these people are efficient  professional  compulsive consumers  it’s their civic duty  consumption  it’s the new national pastime  fuck baseball  it’s consumption  the only true lasting american value that’s left  buying things  buying things  people spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need  money they don’t have on things they don’t need  so they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying    percent interest on something that cost        and they didn’t like it when they got it home anyway  not too bright  folks  not too fucking bright  but if you talk to one of them about this  if you isolate one of them  you sit them down rationally  and you talk to them about the low iq’s and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions  right away they start talking about education  that’s the big answer to everything  education  they say  we need more money for education  we need more books  more teachers  more classrooms  more schools  we need more testing for the kids   you say to them   well  you know  we’ve tried all of that and the kids still can’t pass the tests   they say   don’t you worry about that  we’re going to lower the passing grades   and that’s what they do in a lot of these schools now  they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass  more kids pass  the school looks good  everybody’s happy  the iq of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a fucking pencil  got a pencil  get the fuck in there  it’s physics  then everyone wonders why    other countries graduate more scientists than we do   educaation   politicians know that word  they use it on you  politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things  the flag  the bible and children   no child left behind  no child left behind   oh  really  well  it wasn’t long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start  head start  left behind  someone is losing fucking ground here  but there’s a reason  there’s a reason  there’s a reason for this  there’s a reason that education sucks  and it’s the same reason that it will never ever  ever be fixed  it’s never going to get any better  don’t look for it  be happy with what you got  because the owners of this country don’t want that  i’m talking about the real owners now  the real owners  the big  wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions  forget the politicians  they’re irrelevant  the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice  you don’t  you have no choice  you have owners  they own you  they own  everything   they own all the important land  they own and control the corporations  they’ve long since bought and paid for the senate  the congress  the state houses  and city halls  they got the judges in their back pocket  and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear  they’ve got you by the balls  they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying  lobbying to get what they want  well  we know what they want  they want more for themselves and less for everybody else  but i’ll tell you what they don’t want  they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking  they don’t want well informed  well educated people capable of critical thinking  they’re not interested in that  that doesn’t help them  that’s against their interest  that’s right  they don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard    fucking years ago  they don’t want that  you know what they want  they want obedient workers  obedient workers  people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay  the longer hours  the reduced benefits  the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it  and now  they’re coming for your social security money  they want your fucking retirement money  they want it back  so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street  and you know something  they’ll get it  they’ll get it all from you sooner or later  because they own this fucking place  it’s a big club and you ain’t in it  you and i are not in the big club  by the way  it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe  all day long beating you over the head  and their media telling you what to believe  what to think and what to buy  the table is tilted  folks  the game is rigged and nobody seems to notice  nobody seems to care  good  honest  hard  working people  white collar  blue collar  it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on  good  honest  hard working people continue  these are people of modest means  continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them  they don’t give a fuck about you  they don’t care about you  at all  at all  at all  yeah  you know  and nobody seems to notice  nobody seems to care  that’s what the owners count on  the fact that americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red  white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day  because the owners of this country know the truth  it’s called the american dream  because you have to be asleep to believe it  your email address will not be published  required fields are marked   name  e mail

about   that’s the thing about offense  it’s about personal feelings  i don’t care about the backlash   comedian in hot water   you know  my girlfriend  jane  she worries  and she reads things   what have you said    don’t worry  they won’t come to the house  fuck ’em   so i wind her up  i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would  i have to make up worse jokes than i actually  just to scare my girlfriend  when i do the golden globes  we go out about a week before  it’s in la  we fly out  i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches  they release more presenters  i take my pick   i got a good intro for them  yeah  mel gibson  i’ll introduce him  yes   about three days before this last one  just to wind jane up  i said   i got a good intro   she went   what   i said   bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch  please welcome helen mirren   i didn’t do it  she said   you won’t do that   i said   no   next day  i got her again  i said   is this too much   i said   not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast  please welcome melissa mccarthy   i didn’t do it  i would never  i’d never  tell a joke like that  it’s horrible  i was just doing it to annoy jane  i’d never even  think  of that  so don’t  even on the day  on the way to the red carpet  in the limo  i said   i’ll start with a funny one liner  an old fashioned joke   she went   what   i said   what did the deaf  dumb and blind orphan get for christmas   jane went   i don’t know   i said   cancer   i didn’t do it  so  you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist  so  i’d never say that in public  so  to anyone who mattered  anyway  so  don’t  i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone  it just happens  the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke  outrage on twitter the next day  i mean a couple of people going   it was transphobic   it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest  it was a joke about a trans person  but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence  and that’s the other thing about offense  people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target  they’re not necessarily the same  i’ll tell you the joke  you make your minds up  it’s live  so they go   your host for the   th annual golden globes awards  please welcome ricky gervais   they’re all clapping  the actors are smiling at me  nervously  it’s brilliant  right  so  i just go   relax  i’m gonna be nice tonight  i’ve changed  not as much as bruce jenner  obviously   and i go   now caitlyn jenner  of course   and what a year she’s had  became a role model for trans people everywhere  bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes  she didn’t do a lot for women drivers   that’s a clever joke  i’ll tell you why  right  it’s layered  no  listen  right  the subject of that joke is stereotypes  i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes  i start by saying she’s a real woman  a liberal  progressive attitude  then if she’s a real woman  i hit them with the old fashioned stereotype  she must be a bad driver  then  right  the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car  let’s not forget that  shall we  a celebrity killing someone in their car  running home and popping on a dress  that’s  the target of the joke  just so we’re clear  okay  she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers  now cancelled  and  one of the press said   what do you think of the ricky gervais joke   she went   maybe i should host the golden globes   and they tweeted that and   ed me in  because they want a celebrity feud  it was clickbait  i rose to the bait  obviously  i just sent back   let her host  just don’t let her drive   another website that was in the room  entertainment weekly  they tweeted a different headline  and they   ed me in  their headline was  caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais   i just sent back   at last  she always brakes too late   bring it on  bring it on  but i’m a considered comedian  i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair  so i was engaging these people  saying   why is it transphobic   they said   it’s about a trans person   that’s ridiculous  that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist  it depends on the joke  but i’m willing to learn  i found out my crime was that i dead named her  i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes  and that was saying her old name  and even acknowledging she used to be a man  but she did  i saw him on the olympic games  he was a decathlete  he was in everything  all over the place  shot put and pole vault  he won a medal  he was famous  he was on telly all the time  you know  a big  famous  man  with a huge  i don’t know  i’m guessing  probably  he was big  but i’ve learnt my lesson  now i know it’s wrong  i’d never dead name her now  but  years ago  when she was a  man  years ago  i’m saying  and she went to the  doctor  and  knocked on the door  the doctor went   come in   this is years ago  i’d never dead name her now  but this is like  a flashback before anyone  you know what  so  so  like   come in   and he went   hello  bruce jenner   because that  that was his name  then  the doctor  this was years ago  the doctor went   all right  bruce jenner  how you doing  you fucker  you big old lunk  how you doing  come here  you  you fucker  how you doing  brucie boy   and bruce jenner  that was his name  this is years ago  right  so  bruce jenner went   yeah  yeah  not too bad  doctor  yeah    what can i do for you  bruce  you fucker  how you doing  boy   and bruce jenner went  that was his name  bruce jenner went   look at that   the doctor went   come on  bruce jenner  you know the rules   he uses his whole name every time  for some reason   come on  bruce jenner  you fucker  you know the rules  you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here  mate   bruce jenner went   no  that’s not my pole  that’s my enormous penis    well  seeing as it’s your penis  you can bring it in here  but you should have left your shot puts outside   and bruce jenner went  that was his name for  fifty eight years  i think  he went   no  they’re not my shot puts  doctor  they’re my enormous testicles   that’s where i keep my testosterone  and my spunk  and shit  right  and the doctor went   oh yeah  that makes perfect  i’m a medical man  you’re a big bloke  you fucker  how you doing  boy  you’re a big  you’re big  and you would have a big old  cock and  balls  they’re beautiful   bit familiar  innit   no  you must be very proud of them  bruce   bruce went   this is going to surprise you  doctor  i wanna get rid of them   and the doctor went   what  why    oh  they get in the way    in the way of what    fucking driving  for one thing   so  i’m engaging these people  and i’m saying   but i had to say her old name  that’s the joke  i say   i’ve changed  not as much as bruce jenner   then i do the joke   but  no  this is my second crime  i say  she hasn’t changed  she’s always identified as a woman  that means she’s a woman  fine  if that’s the rules  if you feel you’re a woman  you are  i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far  in fact  i don’t think it’s going far enough  cause i’ve always identified as a chimp  right  well  i am a chimp  if i say i’m a chimp  i am a chimp  pre op  but  don’t ever dead name me  don’t call me ricky gervais again  from now on  you call me bobo  i’m gonna have species realignment  i’m halfway there  i’m short  with short legs and long arms  i stoop  my back’s getting hairier by the day  i’ve got fangs  like that  i love nuts  i love nuts  once  i was at the zoo  and people were looking at me  so i just started masturbating  like  so  i am a chimp  right  i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp  i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year  then have hormones  get me all nice and hairy  that’d be lovely  i’m gonna stay a male chimp  so i can keep all that  right  male  heterosexual chimp  keep the same girlfriend  jane would be happy  she loves me  she loves chimps  so  you know  i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp  we’re so close  than for a man to turn into a woman  in many ways  a bit of hair  and a top lip like that  as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off  and a hole gouged out  into  i’m not a doctor  but that is  the gist of it  i know which one i’d rather have done  i’m not saying chimps are better than women  no way  right  any ladies here  i can’t see you  but  to me  every single one of you is equal  to a chimp  so  so  i’d have all that done  hair and that  i’d do all that  all the  i’ll retain the ability to speak english  like in emergencies  i’m talking to jane  she’s going   what is it    what is it  bobo    you left the fucking oven on  there’s a fire   are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf  and there was a big fence but she had a long pole  she’d  revert  she’d be over that fucking  easy  so i’d have all that done  top lip  doing all that  right  i’ll be legally a chimp  i’ll be well  properly chimped up  i’ll be able to use chimp toilets  i’ll be walking along  holding jane’s hand   come on  bobo   right  we don’t hold hands now  i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp  but we’ll be all in love  maybe matching jumpers   come on  bobo   in love  just two  like that  then  if a bigot in a van slows down and goes   that’s fucking disgusting   i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree  and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic  so  cheers  so  humanity  what is humanity  what are we  well  we’ve touched upon it there  we’re great apes  not metaphorically  we’re literally great apes  we are       genetically identical to a chimpanzee  we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas  we left our common ancestor about six million years ago  we have the same life cycle  same as any other animal  which is  our parents mate  we’re born  we grow  we mate  our parents die  our friends die  and then we die  now  my seven year old niece didn’t like hearing that  but i said   you’ve gotta learn  stop crying   i said   you’re seven  you know  today  so  any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled  so   let’s take the first of those  birth  it’s odd  because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period  i mean  because of our evolution  our brain is so big  we have to get that huge head out early  that’s why the skull is in parts and supple  then we go on gestating outside the womb  that’s why we’re so useless  look at other mammals  a giraffe is walking along  it goes   i’m proper pregnant   right  i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here  yeah  there it is  see you later  and the baby goes   mum   it’s got to be fucking ready  we’re  we’re helpless  right  just think  nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment  everything’s  it’s like being in a little kate bush video  right  then  suddenly  you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass  you’re covered in shit  there’s screaming  you go   i can’t breathe   someone goes   yes  you fucking can   the first one second of life on earth  you don’t know where you are  you can’t choose where you’re born  i was born in whitley estate in reading  right  i wouldn’t have chosen that  i’d have chosen hampstead  i did choose hampstead  it just took    years to be able to afford it  very different  very different  my upbringing to how i live now  now i live a privileged life  hampstead is ridiculous  it’s a rarefied place  it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me  new money  right  but  growing up  it was tough  i don’t know about now  but in my day  my estate was rough and scary  it felt like wildlife  i was weak and vulnerable  there was danger round every corner  my school was on my street and i ran there every day  so i didn’t get mugged or molested  there weren’t many pedophiles in reading  the murderers had killed a lot  but there was still a couple  i moved to hampstead  oh my god  there’s no crime  i saw a knife once in hampstead  it was a palette knife  just a bloke  oil painting  in the middle of the street  broad daylight  no one gobbing on it or calling him  bender   it was weird  i know my life has changed drastically  it wasn’t always like that  as a famous person  you read about yourself  gossip and twitter and everything  one thing kept cropping up  even as i prepared for this tour  people kept saying   he’s out of touch  he’s so famous  he’s rich  he’s mega rich   i am  right  i could have this place burnt down for a laugh  no  but they say things like   he’s an observational comedian  how can he say things that relate to ordinary  scum   and i say   i say   don’t call them scum  right   but even the papers  they try and  get around to it  i do interviews and they’ll always say   do you always fly first class   i go   no  often private   right  the number of times i’ve answered this question  they say   do you know how much a pint of milk is   to make you look out of touch  i don’t know  but that’s irrelevant  next time a journalist asks me  i’ll say   i don’t know  but here’s a grand  run and get me one   is that enough  that enough  yeah  another question i always get  particularly with the posh sundays  doing a profile piece  they’re still trying to alienate you  make you look different  they say things like   you don’t have children   i say   no    why don’t you have children   which is an odd question  why don’t you have children  as opposed to asking people   why do you have children   let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight  shall we  nine  that one just fell out  that one didn’t even touch the sides  or  disturb her cigarette  that one just  go and claim for that  people say it’s selfish to not have children  how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level  there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going   we want to be born   right  but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children  three main reasons and i’ll share them with you  three reasons  one  there’s millions  the world’s over populated  no one’s going   rick’s not having kids  we’re gonna run out  fuck   two  kids are scroungers  aren’t they  i mean  from day one  it’s all  me  me  me   isn’t it   feed me    clothe me    pay for my chemotherapy   no  no  not my problem  son  not mine  luck of the draw  boy  luck of the draw  it costs the average household in the west          to bring up a child  and they don’t want to pay you back  they’re not grateful  they don’t go   thanks for having me   it’s  i didn’t wanna be born   even if they get a top job  which they won’t  you’ll never see that money back  they’ll just put you in a home  okay  and my kid  he’d be born into ridiculous wealth  wouldn’t he  so  he’d be a little cunt  a little hampstead cunt  running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts  being all hampstead and cunty   i’m a little hampstead cunt   yes  i know   these are my cunty friends   i know  it’s obvious  i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts  you little posh hampstead  first  he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt   i’m a little   yes  we know  everyone knows  right  he’d know that  right  on the other hand  he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad  i’d say   i worked my way up from nothing  and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt   he’d go   yeah   and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit  eleven  twelve  he’d be naughty  run with the wrong crowd  try and get out from under my shadow  then he’d turn to drugs  about     he’d come home  and overdose on my afghan rug  twenty grand  that was  right  and as he was there  convulsing  and throwing up his fucking lungs  right  and with his little posh  high pitched  fucking death rattle  his little fucking dying words  he’d go   do you love me now  daddy   no  no  no  i never did  that’s why you’ll never be born  you useless  fucking junkie  hampstead cunt  and  three  i’d worry sick about him  you know  no i would  i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her  i check the door three times when i go out  so she doesn’t escape  i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish  a human baby  oh my god  the responsibility of a human life  i’d watch it sleep  you know  we said how weak and vulnerable they are  oh  my god  you perfect little thing  oh  you flesh of my flesh  now  go to sleep in your expensive cot  like that  night  night  sleep tight  don’t let the bedbugs  dead  yeah  just  why  why is it dead  it’s just fucking dead  look  fuck’s sake  fucking hell  what the  what a fucking waste of time that was  fuck’s sake  embarrassing   jane     what     come here     i’m in the shower     come here    what    fucking dead already  i didn’t  just fucking  fucking hell  jane  you call that a baby  that is   if jane was out  i’d have to text her  wouldn’t i  what could you   baby’s dead   she’d come back   what the fuck   i’d go   yep  forget the pampers  lol   but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years  and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables  with their sharp edges  i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it  cave its head in and die  then social services come round and say   is this your child  mr  gervais     yeah     what happened here  then   i go   it’s a fucking idiot   i did think of adopting for a while  a little third world child  because that would tick all three boxes  one  i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem  i’d be alleviating an existing problem  a young kid born  through no fault of his own  into abject poverty  he would have died  i can literally save his life  and give him a great upbringing  right  two  he would be grateful  wouldn’t he  he’d wanna pay me back  woudn’t he  particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky  they didn’t  they didn’t make it out  right  i’d tell him that early on  so he really bucked his ideas up  i’d go   tunde  come here  come here  yeah  yeah  go and pop a shirt on  you’re not in africa now  that’s better  yeah  tunde  look  yeah  water straight out of a tap  innit  yes  yeah  yeah  no  it’s not free  it’s hampstead  you know  but  yeah  course it’s safe  safe  fresh drinking water  have as much as you want  have a bucket full  fresh drinking water  there you go  go and clean the car  go on   no  i’d go   look  remember all your friends in the village back in africa  they’re all dead  a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead   do you wanna pay me back     yeah    yeah  i bet you do   the good thing about them is  they can start work when they’re about  six  i just call up nike and i go   do you still make your stuff in sweatshops  got a great little worker here  yeah  pound a day’s fine  he’s gotta start somewhere  and  three  if he ran round and caved his head in  and died  and social services came round and said   is this your child  mr gervais   i’d go   does it look like mine   i’d go   this is hampstead  it’s obviously broken in   that’s why i don’t have kids  even though i don’t have children of my own  people still show me photos of theirs  like i give a shit  i don’t mean my own family  they’ve given up  i’ve got older brothers and sisters  they’ve had loads of kids  and their kids have kids  and then their kids  there’s about     i don’t know all their names  i see them at christmas  it’s all  uncle ricky   they know i’ve got a bit of cash  they go through my pockets  and then fuck off  it’s like being mugged by mice  right  i don’t mean them  i mean strangers  i could be busy  i could be working  like on the set of a tv or film or something  stressed  producing or directing it  you get someone who’s in for one day  with one line  or a stuntman  they introduce themselves   good  be with you in a minute   then they hover    busy    i go   yeah  yes  yeah   they go   working the weekend   i go   not filming  but i’ll be in the edit    i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons    ah  great  great    yeah  she’s eight    i’ve got a photograph   i go   you know what  show me it if she goes missing  i’ll keep an eye open in the woods   you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole  and go   she’s beautiful   it’s gotta be long  too short  it’s awkward  they know  you go   yeah  right   too long and it’s like   she’s  she’s fucking beautiful   it’s a minefield  innit  so  i’m not out of touch  but i am spoiled  there’s a difference  i didn’t have any money until i was     i’ve got the same family  friends and values  but i am spoiled  because opportunity and privilege spoils you  and it doesn’t take much  i’l give you an example  when i first made it in america  the next time we flew  we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing  and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side  the first time  you’re horrified   everyone’s looking   pretending to be late  baseball cap  oh  god  next time we flew  i went   where’s that bloke  i’m not queueing   it’s quick  when i fly to the states  i’ve got a place there  but i’m always working  so  someone else is paying  so  i go first class  ba  it doesn’t get any better  even if i was paying  i’d still go first class  but jane would probably be in coach  it’s ten grand a pop  that new planet of the apes movie’s on  she’ll love that  she’ll be up for that  but when someone else is paying  i say   jane  get up here with me   right  front two seats  they board us early  we’re on the plane about    minutes before anyone else  god  they bring round these snacks  these warmed  caramelized nuts in a bowl  champagne  it’s great  it’s like a day off  no phone or anything  it’s like a holiday  flying to the states  i could do without the safety video  that’s always a bit of a downer  and totally pointless  if you hit the side of a mountain at     miles per hour  the brace position does fuck all  imagine if that worked  you’re going down  the plane smashes  you go   i’ll try it   you do that  ball of flames  you wake up  everyone’s dead  you go   fucking hell  that’s amazing  that is   and they always use that voice  don’t they  that calming  hypnotic voice  like   nothing bad will happen   they’re saying horrendous things  but nothing bad will happen  because i’m using this voice  don’t worry  things like   in the event of the plane landing on water   it smashes the fuck to bits  right  they say   in the event of the plane landing on water  your life jacket is equipped with a whistle   a fucking whistle  so  the plane hits the water  smashes to bits  everyone’s dead  except you  by a miracle  you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean  four degrees  that water is  you’ve got about    minutes before hypothermia sets in  or you’re eaten by a shark  or you drown  you’re hoping they’ve sent air sea rescue  you’re going   god  i’m gonna die  i don’t know what i’m doing   hold on  i mean  air sea rescue  i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter  o course you haven’t  but  they’re fucking loud  it’s like having your head in a washing machine  you have to wear ear plugs and defenders  your teeth rattle  it’s like  like that  over the atlantic ocean at night  never gonna happen  if you crash  you die  right  but apart from that  it’s brilliant  right  i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas  right  boarded us early  on the plane  she comes round   champagne in a wine glass  like you like it  mr  gervais   she goes off  i go   have you got any of them warm nuts   she went   we’re not handing out nuts on this flight  a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic  even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction   i went   oh  my god  of course   i was fuming  i mean  what’s that got to do with me  why can’t i eat nuts  just cause  fucking  this woman will  die  right  nuts  how has she lived this long  if walking by a nut kills you  if being  just near a nut  how has she never been near a nut  before  and how has she lived long enough  having never been near a nut  how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane  right  honestly  it’s  and if being near a nut kills you  do we really want that in the gene pool  i mean  i never wanted nuts more  i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts  and this is how spoiled i am  okay  i actually had this thought  i thought   oh  i wish i’d brought my own nuts on   right   i thought for a second  but that wouldn’t work  she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog  right  like that  and  die  and someone would go   ricky gervais brought his own nuts on   you know  right  so i don’t take my own nuts on  now  before i fly  i have a shower  and then i rub myself all over  in nuts  just in case  then i go   can i have any nuts   they go   no  sorry  this lady would die    yeah  not a problem   lady gets on  sits down  starts blowing up like a frog  i go   what’s the matter   i touch her all over   what’s the matter   she goes   nuts   right  and dies  and i go   who’s been eating nuts   i get off scot free  so i got to america  i went on a chat show  tonight show with jimmy fallon  and i told that story  the whole thing  it went well  audience laughed  great  went out  next day on twitter  outrage  by  outrage   i mean one person going   how dare you   this woman goes   i saw you on jimmy fallon  making fun of nut allergies  my daughter’s nut intolerant  how dare you   i go   who is this woman   she’s tweeted    times  she starts   ing nbc and jimmy fallon  i go   what’s this  how many followers  twenty three  ignore it   you know when you’re being told off  and they use your own words against you  like a teacher going   so  you find so and so funny   and cause the teacher’s really angry  yes  you do find that thing funny  whatever  she said   would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog   yeah  yeah  you saying that  yes  if you said that at the funeral  i would  yeah  so  someone else gets involved  ohio moms against nuts  right  and she does a blog  and they’re talking to each other  and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am  one filmed her little girl  put it on youtube  and sent me it  i opened it  sweet little girl  seven years old  and she went   dear mr  gervais  i have a fatal nut allergy   delete  not my problem  right  ignore  ignore  ignore  right  but then one of them said something that reeled me in  just cause i’m this self confessed twitter police  i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means  particularly in the context of comedy  and in the context of a joke  a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing  or necessarily condoning the bad thing  it could be anti the bad thing  it depends on the actual joke  and this woman said   you should never make jokes about food allergies   i should have left it  right  i sent back   i make jokes about aids  cancer  famine  and the holocaust  and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies   she sent back   yes  but the holocaust didn’t kill children   well  it did  didn’t it  it was horrible  the holocaust  some would say as bad as food allergies   didn’t kill children   jesus  it did kill children  hitler killed    million people  many of them children  i have to say  hitler  you couldn’t make him up  the worst human being to walk the face of the earth  he is a crazy  evil  racist  narcissistic serial killer  just terrible  but  if i was throwing a dinner party  and i’d been slaving over a hot stove  and i was getting everything ready  and there was one place left  and i had to  either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies  i know who’d ruin that party more  everyone’s enjoying it   everything okay    ja  ist yummy   right  he’s loving it  i go   cheers  you fucker  how you doing  boy   she’s going   i can’t eat that   fucking hell   who wants ferrero rocher    me    all right  here    i can’t eat them   oh  fuck off home  right  that’s what the world’s like  people see something they don’t like  they expect it to stop  as opposed to deal with their emotions  they want us to care about their thing as much as they do  it’s why the world is getting worse  and the world is getting worse  i think i’ve lived through the best    years of humanity       to       the peak of civilization  for everything  for tolerances  for freedoms  for communication  for medicine  now it’s going the other way a bit  last couple of years  just a little blip  maybe  i’m not saying this because i’m old  old people say things like   oh  everything was better when i was a kid   course it was  you were a kid  everything’s better when you’re a kid  being old is the shit bit  whatever’s happening  being old is  i wake up these days  and i go   oh fuck  i didn’t die   gotta do it all again  i’m usually hung over  headache  liver pains  i can’t walk for the first five minutes  ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees  i’m getting fat again now  right  i was thin till i was about     proper skinny  like nine and a half stone  then i got a job  right  and the next  sort of     years were what i call my eating years  and i just got steadily fatter and fatter  until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness  when i was about    years old  there was one christmas  i was at home  lying on the floor  and  i was saying to jane   i’m having a heart attack   right  and  honestly  my heart rate was like      i felt nauseous  i had palpitations  i was sweating  because i’d eaten eleven sausages  true story  right  i was like one of them snakes  like when you see a big  like  python swallow a pig whole  and then it’s just fucked  it’s  like  it’ll sit there for a week  it’s like a duffel bag  just there  like that  that was me  right  i wasn’t having a heart attack  but it worried jane  she said   you gotta look after yourself   i thought   you’re right       so i started working out  right  every day  i didn’t give anything up  i don’t eat meat anymore  but i was having            calories a day  including wine every night  but i burnt it off the next day  just so i could do all that  i worked out every day  running  weight training  i had more time on my hands than the average person  i had a gym in my house  i had no excuse  i lost    pounds  it was great  but now  i still eat and drink too much  but i physically can’t  burn off the calories  i can’t do enough  cause i’m so old and broken and tired  so  i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again  and this time i am going to die  i’m losing my hair  it’s getting really thin  i know it looks great from there  cheers  but  no  honestly  in a lift  with that light directly overhead  and the mirror  it looks like an x ray  right  i’ll have to buzz that off soon  i’d never wear a wig  oh  my god  if you wear a wig or a toupee  and you think you’ve got away with it  you haven’t  everyone knows  everyone knows immediately  my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do  right  i could be at a party  it’ll go   there’s a wig in here    i go   is there     yes  there is  yeah   spidey senses for the wig  it’s obvious  the way they smile  like nothing’s wrong  hiya  it’s the telltale signs  isn’t it  i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald  great bloke  he’s dead now  died a few years ago  i was only little  he went bald in his twenties  tragically bald  his hair fell out  it might have been something like alopecia  but he was bald for ten years into his thirties  turns up one day at our house   elvis  what is   i was about eight  i said to auntie edna   what happened   she went   it was a miracle   they were lying  they were just  everyone knew he was bald  but he’d embroiled his family in the lie  so they had to lie as well  they’re going   yeah  it just grew back   there’s so much he wouldn’t do  cause he was terrified of the wig coming off  we weren’t allowed balloons at parties  right  auntie edna said   reg is allergic to balloons   he wasn’t allergic  he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater  and his wig would fly across the room  we’ve got photos in the family album  if he’s at a wedding or a christening  and he’s holding a baby  it’s always at arms’ length  like that  so it can’t grab his wig  it must have been on his mind all the time  right  it was the only thing he feared  the wig coming off in public  and this ridiculous lie being exposed  he was in the army  hard as nails  he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything  spiders  snakes  cancer  how’s the chemo going  uncle   not a problem   we’ve got a photo of him  the last year  i think  he was     it must have been the last year he was alive  it was a hot day  he was in the garden  in his little trunks  he was a wizened little man by then  white chest hair  jet black wig still  died in it  buried in it  he’s wearing it now  a little skeleton with jet black hair  like posh spice for eternity  but i knew that was gonna happen  i knew i would get old and fat and  ill and blind and deaf and  shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket  you’re ready  because you’re warned  you know about getting old  what they don’t talk about  so you’re not prepared  and it was a shock to me  i only found out recently  i’ll share it with you now  the distending testicles  see  you don’t know about it  but it happens in your fifties  i wasn’t checking them or anything  i didn’t see ’em for    years  as a young man  they were pert  and now they’re like two plums in a sock  i don’t know when it happened  but it was recently  they just  and this is how i found out  so  as i’ve been getting older  and they’ve been secretly stretching away  as i’ve got older  i’ve got richer  so my baths have been getting more luxurious  last year  i moved into a new house in hampstead  big bath  big sunken bath  south facing windows  i was in there the first night  lovely bath  sun streaming in  classical music  this is the life  i looked down  and they’re floating  right  now  i’d never dreamt that testicles would float  they seem like they’d be heavy  you could tie things down with them  and they’d sink  you know  most people never see their  in the sea  you’re in trunks  in the shower  they dangle  and baths aren’t usually that deep  that was my first thought   oh  my god  i never thought testicles would float   then my second thought kicked in   hold on  this bath’s two feet deep   right  i’m sitting on the bottom  they’re on top  what’s going on  right  and  i looked  and my testicles are now longer than my penis  easily  by some way  right  in fact  they’d created  a little  fleshy sort of life raft  right  my penis was dry  just nestled  just  floating on top  like that  like that  just bouncing around  i should have given it a little whistle  i’m just thinking   this is bizarre   fucking hell  right  and  i thought   maybe it’s a fluke   so i held them under the water for a minute  i let them go and they bobbed up  they’re really  they’re really buoyant  right  try it when you get home  if you’re in your   s  and a man  obviously  or caitlyn jenner  but  but the world is getting worse  and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media  because twitter and facebook  that’s where this ridiculous notion bred  and became stable  that it was more important to be popular than right  everything was  like me    agree with me   it falls into two tribes   i don’t agree with them  so i block them   and now  in this post truth era  people don’t care about the argument  they say   who’s saying the argument  no  they’re not on our side   it’s ludicrous  okay  and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had  my opinion is worth as much as yours  now  it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact  which is nonsense  i get tweets from people saying   i believe the earth is       years old    i believe you’re a fucking idiot   you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth  you can have opinions  but not your own facts  but it was all about being popular  right  and even politicians picked up those symptoms  politicians tweet now  they want to be popular  we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck  they didn’t want to make a mistake  and there’s a ridiculous thing of   let’s ask the average person what they think   let’s stop asking the average person what they  do you know how fucking stupid the average person is  we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say  do not drink   right  let’s take those labels off  right  for two years  and then have a referendum  but it’s not just politicians  even real news  the news on tv says things like   tweet us your news   don’t let them tweet you the news    i saw a tyrannosaurus rex    you liar  right  there was a big news story last year  about a train crash that happened a year before  and there was an inquiry  the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news  he said   we’ve looked at everything  and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor  so we’re going to slow them down a bit  statistically  this shouldn’t happen again   that would have been it  but the guy went   we asked the public what they thought   then there was three banal vox pops  first one said   i already pay      a year  so i’m not happy   the next one said   it takes me    minutes each way  it’s not good enough   the last one said   i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead   why is that on the news  and when is that applicable in any situation  all right  ted  you’re in early  ted  oh  ted  we’ve been through this  remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead  but  the big enemy is stupidity  right  i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got  now  admittedly  when i first got on twitter  i pushed my agenda  i was an outspoken atheist  not to change anyone’s opinions  i thought it was important to tell the other side  there are still    countries where people are put to death for being an atheist  i just wanted to say   it’s fine to be an atheist  it’s fine to believe in god  and it’s fine not to   that’s all i was saying  i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism  i could tweet a fact  and that annoyed just the right people  i’d tweet things like  happy birthday  earth  four point six billion years old today   someone would always go   we know what you’re fucking doing   this is a tweet i got after one of those  and  it was all in capitals  which excited me  that’s the sign of twitter madness  mixed with anger  it’s great  right  i looked at his profile  sure enough  he’s a gentleman from texas  he’s a fundamentalist  creationist christian  which is fine  he loves god  he loves god and  fetuses  mainly  he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay  and then he’s  remember it’s in capitals  he’s shouting at me  best tweet ever   your science   my science  right  science  by the way  is spelled s c i e n t s  already good  isn’t it  i mean  he’s obviously heard the word  he took a guess  never seen it written down  because it’s not in the bible  so he’s   your scients won’t help you  well  it will  it’s helping him  beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me   your scients won’t help you when satan   of course he believes in satan  why not  he believes that god made the universe in six days  you’re not gonna say to him   do you believe in satan   and have him say   bit far fetched   why doesn’t god kill satan  that’s  what i’d ask him  if i was wrong and i met god  i’d go   oh  you do exist   he’d go   yeah   i’d go   i’ve got a few fucking questions  mate  the first one would be   why did you make chocolate kill dogs   mental  right  also  if you hate homosexuality so much  why did you put the male g spot up the arse  what  what is wrong with you  then i’d say   why don’t you kill satan   and he’d go   what   i’d go   why don’t you kill satan  if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff  which you want  i mean  you do want    yes  yeah    you could kill him if you wanted  you can do anything  easy    yeah    why don’t you kill him  then    because  shut up    your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass   and he’s got a point  because if i die  and i find myself in hell  being raped by satan  science has pretty much let me down  but it’s this last line that he just throws away  the line he signs off with  makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received   your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass  i’ll be laughing   so  he’s there too  he’s  so  he’s a fundamentalist  christian  who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments  he dies  he wakes up in hell  right  which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma   oh  my god  i’m in hell  oh  my god  why have you forsaken me  i’m gonna be tortured for eternity   he sees me getting raped and goes   ha  ha  ha   he’s suddenly over it  is he  his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter  and like he’s not next  right  so i’m getting raped  right  by the devil  right  he’s just there   you fucking atheist scum   and i’m like that   yeah  whatever   i assume it happens all eternity   yeah  yeah  whatever   like that  i might say   watch your hooves on my testicles   and he’d go   why are they so distended   and i go   oh  like you’re brad pitt   you know what i mean  sorry  are we talking or raping  can we   you lying  fucking atheist   he’s probably bored   fucking atheists  every fucking day   right  his little gargoyle comes up   satan   he goes   what   and i go   yeah  what   he goes   there’s a fundamentalist christian    fuck this   he’d be on him like a ton of bricks  so  i got that tweet  i loved it  all i did was re tweet  right  and just watch the fun  people piling on  going   ah  loser   and he’s fighting back  really witlessly  saying things like   go fuck your sister  you english faggot   that makes no sense at all  i forgot about it  went and did something else  few hours later  on twitter again  it’s still all going off  right  it’s really funny  i’m laughing at all the replies  people saying things to him  i’m scrolling down  there’s one tweet  directly to me  from this woman  she says   you find rape funny   no  no  what  no   your mates find rape funny   no  listen  right   you find rape funny   listen  everyone  listen  right  no  i said to her   i didn’t tweet that    she went   you retweeted it    to show he’s an idiot   but you must find it funny or amusing  it’s not a frivolous thing   i said   no  well  it’s up to him  isn’t it  he can do it   now i’m arguing with quite a nice  sane person  who thinks this is mental  but i’m fighting for his right  to fantasize about me being raped by the devil  because i’m so conscious of  freedom of speech   what a topsy turvy world  right  although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit  because she did that thing that people do  she didn’t say   what  you find jokes about rape funny   she said   what  you find rape funny   the answer to that is  no  of course not  no one finds rape funny  not even rapists find rape funny  know what i mean  noone ever gives evidence saying   it was dark  he wore a ski mask  and he was giggling   that’s never  so  i sent back   you mean jokes about rape   she said   yes    i went   depends on the joke     it fucking doesn’t   i’m going   no  it does  it does  it depends on the joke  it’s about context  it’s about content  what do you mean by a rape joke   she said   even a joke with the word  rape’ in it is unacceptable   i said   that’s ridiculous  it depends what the joke is   i tweeted that clip of me in the office  going   i think there’s been a rape up there   everyone gets that because of the context  and the target is a middle aged man  who’s so narcissistic  he’ll say anything to win a silly game  you have to understand the joke and where it comes from  i said   some jokes don’t punch up or down  they don’t punch anywhere  they can just be a pun  a play on words  that don’t really mean anything   a joke went round when i was a kid  even adults told it  i’ll tell you  a woman goes running into a police station  she says   help  i’ve been graped   the policeman says   do you mean raped   she says   no  there was a bunch of them   that is a rape joke  right  so   and i even said to her   no  i agree  in most cases  yeah  real rape jokes  they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target  disgusting  i’d never tell those  but it depends on the joke  not the word or the subject   i calmed it down  and they agreed some jokes are worse than others  she ended it by saying   well  okay  i see your point  but  still  i will laugh at a joke with the word  rape’ in it  when no one in the audience has been raped   i should have left it  i just sent back   what a weird door policy   you turn up to a comedy gig  pay your money  someone says   can i just ask you a question   yeah  have you ever been raped  i have  yes  you can’t come in  what  why  a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in  off you go  that’s what the world is like  people take everything personally  they think the world revolves around them  particularly on twitter  i’m not tweeting anyone  i’m just tweeting  i don’t know who’s following me  i’ve got    million followers  they can be following me without me knowing  choose to read my tweet  and then take that personally  that’s like going into a town square  seeing a big noticeboard saying  guitar lessons   and you go   but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons   what’s this  there’s a number here  right  call that  are you giving guitar lessons  i don’t fucking want any  fine  it’s not for you  then  just walk away  don’t worry about it  i should say one thing in twitter’s defense  i use it as a marketing tool and for fun  like everyone else  but one great thing about twitter  for me  personally  i’m very into anti animal cruelty  years ago  it would take ages to get         signatures on a petition  standing outside tesco’s or something  that’s the magic number  because then it gets heard in parliament  i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got         signatures in days  and the law has been changed  thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty  it makes a difference  thank you  but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty  you think no one’s gonna argue with that  yes  they will  they just wanna be heard  i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment  i say   ban bullfighting   someone always says   what about the kids in syria   what  well  i’m not giving you a choice  you can do both  i’m not saying   throw that kid back in the hole  there’s a bull here   and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head  but it exists  so we have to deal with it now that i found out  through twitter  there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival  in china  every year  and it’s horrendous  and we send people with money to buy the dogs  to bring them back  it’s a drop in the ocean  they eat thousands over this weekend  i tweet the details  the petition  people don’t really read it  it’s a knee jerk  people say   racist   i go   what   they go   we eat pigs and cows in the west   yep  we do  i don’t but  yeah  i used to  you’re right  a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog  it’s not about the species  it’s what they do to these poor dogs  what they do is torture the dogs first   cause they think it makes the meat taste better  they beat them  they blowtorch them  they even skin them alive  and i saw this picture  on twitter of the opening of this ceremony  these two guys  in this chinese square  and they’re skinning this dog alive  it’s screaming  they’re laughing  it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen  i thought   i’ve got to tweet that   i tweeted the picture  with a petition  and i just said   one beautiful creature  and two ugly cunts  skinning it alive   right  and it took off  loads of retweets  it made the press  i got one tweet back  from a woman  that said   is that language necessary   i should have left it  right  but i was  i was incensed  i said   you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death   she said   i just hate the c word   i definitely should have left it  i sent back   people who hate the c word would hear it a lot less  if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts   thank you  you’ve been fantastic  good night  cheers  thank you so much  thank you so much  i hope you enjoyed the show  i hope no one was offended  no  i really do  that’s not the point  i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things  without being bad people  i think it’s my upbringing  i grew up  in poverty  with nothing  but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh  that was the men  the women carried on working  it was my older brother  bob  it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes  right in the bad situation  as things were happening  people were laughing  i realized   he’s healing them   that’s what comedy’s for  what humor’s for  it gets us over bad stuff  right  typical bob story  he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island  just asking the cashier how much everything was  just to see if he could break this poor man’s will  bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority  the first authority you come across are your parents  and he’d get in trouble  he got sent to bed  but i thought he’d won the argument  and he’d tease my mum  my mum was a typical working class woman  as i say  we lived in a shitty area  right  and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud  and a stolen bike  and fence posts missing  she mended the fence  turfed the garden herself  painted the step  she thought   if it looked respectable  we’d be respectable   it was about reputation  i guess  bob would send her postcards that just read   is that pedophile postman still reading your mail   and she’d take it  she’d go in  and she’d be horrified  she’d call bob   he saw it this time  you must stop doing that   even at her funeral  my mum died first  and my dad carried on for a year or so  just drinking beer  then he went  at mum’s funeral  we had different duties  i did catering and flowers  bob went to see the local vicar  that was a mistake  right  we’d never been to church  he didn’t know us  we didn’t know him  so  he said to bob   tell me about your mum  so i can say a few words   bob saw that as an opportunity  right  so  bob  with a straight face  said   well  she was a keen racist   the vicar went   i can’t say that   bob said   okay  put she liked gardening   he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church  he didn’t warn us  and he did get something by the vicar  so we’re called ricky  robert  bob  ricky  robert  marsha and larry  now  larry is the oldest  in his seventies  born in the war  i always thought he was the sensible one  first born  weight of the world on his shoulders  my mum said  when he was a teenager  he got a job and gave her the money to help out  he’s a stand up guy  larry  so  bob  gives the vicar the wrong name  didn’t warn us  we’re all in church  start of the funeral  we’re all there  packed out  the coffin comes down  guided by the vicar  the vicar goes to his pulpit  all confident  with his little notes  right  and he goes  eva leaves behind four loving children  ricky  robert  marsha  and barry  and  we snort like that  right  bob’s going  everyone realizes  we’re all laughing  we see larry go  all right  and the church is like  every time we thought of it  we’d see larry go  like that  right  then we’d just start giggling  just fits of fucking giggles  right  larry eventually started doing this  and the vicar’s thinking   what have i said   right  he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again  things that were just lies  or slightly wrong  my nieces and nephews started crying  i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues  they’d take one and hand it on  before the funeral  i’d taken the tissues out  written on them  folded them back and put them in  and each tissue said   snivelling fucking bitch   and they’re sort of laughing  so it was like a madhouse  right  everything the vicar said or did  we all started fucking laughing  right  and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit  he ended the funeral  and he made a beeline for me and bob  he said   sorry  was that okay   me and bob went   fucking brilliant  mate  it was fucking brilliant   that’s what i mean  we’re all gonna die  so we should have a laugh  if you can laugh in the face of adversity  you’re bullet proof  me and my brother  bob  had one simple rule  and that was if you think of something funny  you’ve got to say it  win  lose or draw  it might go well  it might go badly  but you’ve gotta say it  and bear that in mind  as i leave you with this  right  so  we’re all in the car one day  bob’s driving  packed in this car  a little day trip to the beach  we get stopped for a security check  and there’s a british bobby there  and he stops the car  bob’s at the window  he said   where are we off to   bob went   bognor   he went   can you just pop the boot  please   so he looks at that  looks in the boot  like that  back to bob’s window  gets that mirror on a stick thing  and he starts just looking under the car  and as he does that  his helmet falls off  right  and out of the helmet falls a packet of    cigarettes  and the copper went   bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets   and bob went   i knew it wasn’t fucking brains   you’ve been amazing  good night

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ladies and gentlemen  jim jefferies    hello  boston  how you doing  thank you for that  thank you for that  you all getting fucked up   i’m not drinking  i got water   i can’t drink like i used to drink  okay   aww  i used to drink  i used to be a daily drinker  i used to be five drinks  every day  seven days a week  which is    drinks a week  which the fda of america says that means i’m an alcoholic  they say anything over    drinks makes you an alcoholic  bullshit   that’s less than three drinks a fucking day  that’s a reasonable amount of fucking drinking  you can have three drinks a day  there’s nothing wrong with that  you don’t have a problem   two lines of coke a day isn’t a coke problem   it isn’t a coke problem  that’s less than a gram a week   you know why i stopped drinking so much is because i cracked open a beer  and my son  he was five at the time  he looked up at me  he went   daddy  are you drinking again    i’m like   where the fuck did that come from  you little     like  very clearly it was from the woman who i gave a house to  but i was like   so  i don’t  i don’t drink  i don’t drink like that anymore  i don’t drink  ’cause i’m a good dad  you know  so  what i do now is i just drink one day a week  but i still get my    in   that’s how society has pushed me   that’s why if you ever see  like  a woman and she’s like in her mid thirties and it’s      p m  and she’s all dolled up  but it’s like she’s holding her shoes and just stumbling around and vomiting in alleyways  don’t feel sorry for her  she’s just a good mom   found a window of fucking time   the queen of england drinks four cocktails a day  that’s eight standard drinks a day  that means she’s a full blown fucking alkie  full blown   my question is  is she a nice drunk or a fucking nasty drunk  around cocktail three  does she start trawling the palace  just    philip   philip   and philip’s like   ah  fuck  lizzie’s at it again   get my land rover ready    she’s just trawling around   philip    she goes into one room  she jumps back out with a crown on her head   ha ha   i look like the money    i got to tell you a story right now  to tell this story  i have to start off by saying that i’m lactose intolerant   that means that i will not  tolerate lactose   if i eat lactose     minutes later  and you can set your fucking watch by it   i will shit myself   that sounds like more than just intolerance  doesn’t it   i shit myself   like  think about it right now  so  you’re all in groups  right  you’ve probably got groups of three  four friends you’re all hanging out with  and then you have your periphery groups  like  some cunt in your group has brought some friends from work  right  and there’s always one cunt in that fucking group where you  like  you turn to one of your good friends and you go   can’t tolerate that guy  can’t tolerate him   but it’s not like  if he comes near you   you shit yourself   so  my two biggest nemesisises  nemesi     n  the two things that  that i’m not good with   are ice cream and cheese  now  here’s the tragedy that is my life  ice cream and cheese are also my two favorite things   see  i wasn’t always lactose intolerant  no  it happened to me at     i’m    now  it happened on my   th birthday  i was sitting down  having my baskin robbins ice cream cake  as i always request  i’m hoeing into it  and then god looked at me and went   how’s all those atheist jokes going  cunt   pew     so now i can’t eat ice cream and cheese  right  but here’s the thing  i still eat ice cream and cheese   with the full knowledge that i’m going to shit myself  i still fucking do it  right  i  i  actually  what i do is if i have a heavy meal  i eat a scoop of ice cream afterwards ’cause then i know i’ll shit everything out  cause   i’m a genius  you see  that’s the jefferies diet  you can fucking take that home with you   so  i still eat ice cream and cheese  but i don’t eat them out in the wild   you’ll never see me on a boardwalk with an ice cream cone  no  no  no  i eat them at home  amongst people who love me and respect me  where i know where the toilet is  i know how much toilet paper we’ve got  i’m ready to fucking go   so  although i am intolerant of lactose  i still  you could argue  tolerate it   in the same way that my dad  doesn’t hate gay people   he’s just intolerant of them   my father’s a    year old man from rural australia  and when we were growing up  i heard him say the occasional homophobic slur  when he was young  uh  being gay was a mental illness  he’s a product of his environment  but two years ago  australia had a referendum  where they voted on gay marriage  and my father voted  yes   and that’s because i spent time talking to him  going   dad  it’s the right thing   and then my dad said   well  i guess they deserve to be as miserable as the rest of us    now  because my father has done this one forward thinking thing in his entire life  my dad now thinks he is woke as fuck   and my dad says sentences like this   i’ve got no problems with the gays  they can do whatever they want  in their own homes  behind closed doors  as long as they don’t try to involve me    and i’m always like   dad  are they trying to involve you    is there a scenario    where there’s two gay fellas in the inner suburbs of sydney  one’s strapped up to a bed with a fucking gag ball in his mouth  the other one’s lubing up his fist  and he’s about to enter  and just as he’s about to go in  this fella goes   and he goes   what’s that  mate    maybe we should try to involve gary jefferies     oh  that’s a brilliant idea  why didn’t i think of that   he unstraps him  they get in their honda civic  and they fucking drive   it’s a friday night in sydney  it’s raining  you’ve got to get around the harbor  it’s fucking  traffic’s horrendous  it takes them an hour     they get out to the house where my dad lives  my dad’s just sitting there  watching rugby league   he hears a knock on the door     that’s the second time this month   i told you not to involve me    now  i was  uh  touring in sydney earlier this year  and i did that routine  my father was in the audience  and he’d brought along all of his bowling friends  my father plays lawn bowls  uh  every day  uh  which is like  uh  curling but with a ball and  you’ll figure it out  anyway  so he brought these  like  eight mates  and all of his mates were aged between    and     right  all these blokes fucking went along  and then my dad came backstage  they’re all sinking piss backstage  my dad comes up to me and goes   yeah  i enjoyed the show  yeah  it was a good show  good show  different jokes you’re doing now  uh  i didn’t like that bit about me and the two gay fellas  i didn’t    and i didn’t understand why  and it turned out the reason he was upset  not because i spoke about him maybe having sex with two men  but because his friends found out that he voted  yes  for gay marriage   and now  and now all of his mates take the piss out of him  right  every time they go to do their shoelaces  they’re like   will you marry me  gary    that’s the thing about my dad  man  he’s trying  at his age  he’s still trying to be progressive and all that type of stuff  and here’s the problem  with young people  right  so  so  he’s backstage  he’s having a few beers  he’s voted yes for gay marriage  everyone’s teasing him a bit  and then my dad  at     says   oh  yeah  i’m good with the gays  i like the gays   and then he goes   i don’t know about those trans people   and then a person i know started going   well  you’re transphobic  you’re transphobic   and i was like   all right  everyone settle the fuck down   settle down   and i said   this guy just got used to gay people yesterday   let him have his fucking victory lap  you’re going to scare him off  you cunt    like  let him be old  you cunt  he goes like this   gay people are okay   and then you go   chicks with dicks   and he’s like   fuck off    this is the thing about being progressive and being woke and all that fucking bullshit  right  the the the young generations  the millennials  what you’re missing out on is  let old people be fucking old  right  they’ll be dead soon enough  right  stop fucking making everyone move as fast as you’re fucking moving  all right  people are trying  right  here’s the thing about millennials  you’re the worst people that have ever lived    you’re the worst  you’re just a horrible breed of people  and i don’t even blame you  it’s just the society you’re in  you have social media  every single peanut fucking thought that ever came into your head   i’ll fucking comment    what type of fucking low rent cunts are you   like  if you take more than three selfies a week  fucking end it  end it    all right   the idea that you think taking a photo of yourself  isn’t there something mentally wrong with that  and it’s not just  that’s  that’s bad  that’s bad as it is  but the fact that when you take that photo  your next thought is   other people might want to see this    you’re the fucking worst  i  i’ve tried dating you people  it’s a fucking nightmare  right  i don’t care how smooth your fucking skin is  i’ll take an old person with a better fucking attitude  you pricks    you know  you date a millennial  i used to have nice outings  you used to go to a beach  and you’d watch the sunset  no  fuck that  sunsets are ruined because you cunts all want to do yoga poses while i stand back here  going   did i do a good photo    heaven forbid i walk past a wall where someone’s painted some fucking wings on  that’s my whole day fucking ruined   see  here’s the thing about you  you are  the most progressive generation that’s ever been  that is true  you are the most progressive generation that’s ever been  but here’s something for you  every generation before you has also been the most progressive generation that’s ever been  you’re not fucking special    yeah  one day  and you don’t even see it coming  in about    years’ time  you’re gonna be the old bigots   you don’t see it coming  do you  you’ll be the old bigots  you’ll be standing around with your friends  going   i don’t understand the kids today  when i was young  women had penises and men had vaginas  and it was all very normal   but my grandson says he identifies as an asian woman who wants to be a black man and marry a fucking robot  and i’m not having it    so my point is  i can’t eat cheese   so   i can’t  i can’t  it’s not good for me  so  so  i i went on a date with this girl  i went maybe six or seven dates with her  and i took her out to one of those tasting menu restaurants  you know  those fancy restaurants  michelin star thing  where there’s  like     or    courses  this is a good move  for any young fella out there who wants to take a girl out  take them to a tasting menu  because if you’re like me  i eat my food too quick  and then i’ve got to sit there and watch them try to  you know  then i think   how much of that am i gonna get to eat   you know  and if you go to a tasting menu  the brilliant thing about going to a fancy restaurant is that the conversation never stops  because there’s so many courses that you can go   i liked that course  i didn’t like course number three  but i enjoyed seven  so i wonder what’s up next   it’s a good way of keeping things going    now  i tried to do  i tried to do this routine in kansas  very hard to explain    what a really good meal’s like  they fucking  they couldn’t wrap their brain around it  i was like   you know when you go to one of those really fancy restaurants    and i went   think about the best meal you’ve ever had   and then one guy yells out   ribs   and i was like   yeah  yeah  ribs are good   but think of a meal that’s even better than ribs   and he thought about it and he went   two ribs   and i went   yeah    so these restaurants  they’re pretentious as fuck  right  every  every dish includes a foam  a reduction  and a mousse  and there’s always a quail’s egg and a truffle  always with a quail’s egg  why can’t they use a fucking chicken egg   every time i go to the supermarket  i always go to the poultry  i’m never like   oh  quail or chicken  what will we eat tonight   where the fuck are they buying all the quails’ eggs   and come to think of it  i’m not sure  if i’ve ever seen a quail   i’ve never been out and gone   ah  fuck me  the quails are out tonight   better get the car in the garage  don’t want it covered in quail shit  fucking quails   so it’s always a reduction  a mousse  and a foam  next to a quail’s egg with a truffle on top  and the first course is always called the amuse bouche  the amuse bouche is never on the menu  and what this is in fancy food is you eat that  and that’s meant to make you realize what the rest of the meal might be like  it’s to make you go   oh  we’re eating  oh   i get what’s going on  this is a small portion of bigger things   it’s like if before you came to the show  you all went to a smaller comedy club tonight and watched someone do a five minute set  so you could go   i get what jim’s gonna do    and there’s always some french cunt who’s the waiter   i can say this on netflix  the french are a bunch of cunts  i’m not sure if   are you even watching it   on your french netflix    anyway  so there’s always a french fuck   he walks out  and the first course is always served on  like  a ceramic white spoon  with the reduction  the mousse  and the foam  and the quail’s egg  and something on top  and he walks up to you  and he’s very patronizing  and he goes   okay  now it’s time for the amuse bouche   and then he goes   the chef has prepared this for you   and you always  you always nod along  like   oh  that’s good  the chef   when you really should just be an asshole to him and just go   the chef  you say   did you hear that  honey  the chef’s doing the cooking today   i thought the busboy had just fucking stepped it up a gear  but fuck me  i think we’re in for a treat    and then he has the audacity to tell you how to eat it  he goes   uh  the chef recommends that you put the spoon in your mouth and you eat it all in one bite  and let the quail’s egg explode over the foam  the mousse  and the reduction  and then you swallow    all right   when you should really go   thank fuck you came along  cunt   i wouldn’t have known what to do   a spoon  you say  a spoon  i would’ve     so then you go through that  then you get a couple more courses  then there’s always a course that involves something  the ingredients they use aren’t the ingredients that you want to fucking eat  right  if you were to buy a pork product in a supermarket and you were spending money  it would be  like  a pork loin or a chop  right  in these restaurants  it’s always like   this is the kidney of the thing and the fingernail of the hoof  and  and you are getting the rind from the pig’s eye  the eye socket of the pig   and you’re like   oh  i haven’t got enough socket in my fucking diet   at the end you’re like   i’m eating bone marrow  i didn’t know what a bone marrow fan i fucking am   and it’s all shit  it’s all fucking bad for you   i always  i always feel fatter after  this is the deal  right  i’m recording a special right now  so i’ve dropped  like  seven pounds in a week  by just not fucking eating  just not fucking eating  and  i come from a long line of fat people  right  i come from fat people  the reason i  i lose weight is because of you  the general public  and your comments on the internet   without you and your words of wisdom  i’d be a fat fuck  but thank god you all come along  and you fucking bully the fuck out of me   see  i’m not  i’m not for fat shaming  but i kind of am  i kind of am   i’m not for any shaming  really  but i don’t know why we’ve gotten to this moment in society where fat people are immune to being shamed  yet every other addiction in our society is shamed  i watched my mother eat herself to death  i fucking watched it  she hid food  she fucking kept on eating  she denied what she was doing  and she fucking died from it  right  i watched it happen  but for some reason  we have to look at fat people and go   you be your best self  you’re looking great   every other fucking addiction in our society  we shame  you smoke a cigarette  you don’t think smokers feel shame  you don’t think smokers are breathing fucking smoke into their lungs  going   i’m a piece of shit  i’m a parent  what the fuck am i doing with my life   we don’t need you to go   you smell   you’re killing yourself  go outside   there’s a section for people like you    like fucking cocaine addicts  you don’t think they feel shame  every time a cocaine addict has a line  they literally have to look at themselves in the fucking mirror   you don’t compliment a fucking meth addict who’s picking scabs off their face  like   you be you   you’re living your best life   no  but eating  we have to watch people get fat as fuck and compliment them  fuck off  should be the same as smoking  a fat cunt comes into a doughnut store  the person behind the counter should be able to go   you’re gonna have to eat that outside    they’ll go outside with their doughnut  aww  and they’ll have a little roped off section  let’s make it small  give them a fucking incentive   they can stand out there with the other fatties and look at each other and go   oh     do you remember when we were allowed to eat on planes    so  anyway  then we go on through the menu  course number five  now  these fancy restaurants always have a foie gras course  foie gras  it’s fucking delicious  i didn’t know what it was for years  i just enjoyed it  it’s this buttery  fucking fleshy thing  it’s delicious  and then someone showed me a video  do you know how they make foie gras  they get a goose  then they step on its fucking feet  and then they pull the goose’s neck up  like this  and they get what’s called a foie gras funnel  which is like a funnel with a big  long tube  and they shove it down the goose’s throat until the goose looks like a fucking sword swallower   and then they force feed the goose grains  day and night  right  and then after that  they wire the goose’s mouth shut so it can’t vomit the food back up  because of doing this  the goose gets cirrhosis of the liver  and the liver gets fat and yellow  and that’s what gives it that buttery taste   my big question is    who was the first cunt to figure that out   who  who was the first bloke just to walk up to his mates and just go   hey  guys   i was torturing geese    as i always do    and you would not believe the delicious side effects    now  i don’t believe in animal cruelty  uh  but  but who here  uh  thinks that we should no longer test on animals   all right  they’re what we call fucking idiots   if you’re a fucking moron who just applauded   there should be no animal testing   you fucking basic cunt   now  i don’t think we should test on animals for something as frivolous as makeup  but when it comes to medicine  what’s our fucking other option  let’s just think of something really simple  like acne cream  right  you can’t just get a cucumber    smear the cream on the cucumber and go   no change to cucumber   ready for people    no  you’ve got to start with a mouse  don’t you  smear it on the mouse  that mouse dissolves    first cream not good    then you get another cream  that mouse fucking multiplies like a mogwai hit with water    better    than first cream   still  not good    then you get one where it works  then you go   that one’s good   then you get a rat  then you get a rabbit  then you get a cat  then you get a dog  then you get a primate  then you get a homeless person  a student  then us   and that’s how we have the medicine   so moving on  we go to fucking course number six  the waiter brings up a cart  this thing has a dome on the top  and he rocks up with this fucking thing with the dome  he carried all the other food  but this thing needs a trolley   and he pulls it off and there’s all these cheeses there  and he goes   your next course is the fromage   like that  the fro  actually  i don’t like that  i don’t like that the cunt called it fromage   i know it’s a little thing  but it bothers me  he was just doing it to frenchie the fucking experience up   he could’ve said  cheese   he knows the fucking word’s cheese  everything else he said in english  and then he had to say fucking fromage  fuck that cunt   you’re telling me  you’re telling me that he’s  uh  he’s learned the entire english language but he’s just one word short   i don’t like that  i’ll be honest with you here  and this is being recorded  and i’m happy to say this to the whole world  my most hated group in society  is italian americans    and  and  and  look  this is a comedy show  so if there are any italian americans in the room with us this evening  please know that you’re not welcome    you’re a fucking painful bunch of people   pick a fucking accent  either go italian or go american  but don’t flip flop   you’ll be in an italian restaurant  the waiter will seem normal  and then he’ll fucking change  right  you’ll be in an italian restaurant  the guy will go   hey  enjoying your meal  it’s good  right  my mother  she used to make it with the mozzarell   and you’re like    what the fuck happened to that word  cunt   you  it’s like he had a fucking stroke in the middle of the fucking word  mozzarell  fuck you   that’s why i got to give it up for the asians  i like the asians   they pick an accent  and they fucking stick to it   the asians either go full asian  or they go full american  they don’t go back and forth   you’ll never be in an asian restaurant and have the waiter walk up and go   hey  you enjoyed that  you should try it with some soy soy   no  they never do that   so kudos  asians  kudos   anyway  so he rocks up with his fucking cart of cheese  there’s some soft cheeses there  some camemberts and bries and whatnot  the most dangerous cheeses of them all   and i look at the cheese  and now  this  this girl  she does not know of my condition   and i look at the cheeses  i look up at him  and i went   how long    is the rest of the meal    and he said   uh  maybe  uh     minutes   i went   twenty minutes  i’ve got a    minute drive   fromage me    and i got myself a big plate of cheese  and i fucking caned that cunt  i fucking ate all that  we got another couple of courses  they have two dessert courses  one of the courses  the dessert courses  might as well have just been called  lactose    it was a lactose crumble  next to a lactose foam  with a lactose reduction  with a scoop of ice cream  then they freeze dried some lactose crumble table side and sprinkled it on top  and i looked at it  and i was like this   in for a penny  in for a pound    and i ate that bowl of lactose as well  now  what i didn’t mention is the girl i’m on the date with  she is a very petite girl  she had given up around course six   i had also eaten her plate of fromage   and her bowl of lactose   lactose is now coursing through my veins  i am on borrowed time   and so i’m sitting there  knowing  i’m just sort of like   all right  we’ll be good here  we’ll be good   you know  i’m listening to her   oh  that’s interesting    and then the waiter comes up and goes   would you like a coffee   and i went   no   just the check  please    so he gets me the check  now  we’re gonna go back to my place  now  i’d been on a few dates with this girl  we’d always gone back to her place  this time was the first night she was gonna come back to my house  i was happy about going back to my place ’cause i know where all the toilets are  i know the distance  there’s a lot of things that were going on there  and because she was staying at my place  she goes to me  she goes   oh  we have to stop at the pharmacy  because there’s a a a cream that i need  like a lotion type of thing   and i said   that you need    and i i i said  i said   are you sure you don’t want it    and she goes   no  i  no  i need it   and i said   i don’t know if you know the difference between wants and needs   like  if you need it  that means that you’ll die    if you don’t have it  so  do you need it    and she claimed to need it  so  we drove off to the pharmacy  we get in there  right  we walk in this rite aid  and there’s just this wall of fucking lotions and that type of stuff  and i thought she needed it so she would know which one to grab   but she’s just sort of looking at them  like this  right  and i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  box step     like this    and she can’t pick one  now  this is the thing  she has to get a lotion  i don’t understand what’s going on with the whole lotion thing with women  right  i  okay  i’ve lived with  uh  six girlfriends in my life   in my  in my life  i’ve lived with six women  and all six of them have left me   and sooner or later  i’m going to blame myself   but not today    now   now  every single woman i’ve ever lived with has a nighttime ritual  where they  see  i have a bedtime ritual  what i do is i go to the bathroom  i have a piss  i brush my teeth  i go to bed   i’ve recently figured out that i could do them at the same time   i have a piss and i brush my teeth  and i spit over  like that  now  but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for  like     minutes  and you close the door  and then you come out  and the last thing you do is you’re sort of  you’re rubbing something here   and then you go like this   and then you get into bed  and you tell me what i’ve done wrong that day    and that’s your little nighttime routine   now  i don’t know what goes on in that room   but i assume  i can’t be positive  but i assume you are covering your body head to toe in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence   now  i’m    years old  um  i i wear makeup for work  like  when i’m on tv  they put makeup on me  i never even wipe it off  i just fucking  they give me a towelette  and i go   ah  don’t worry about it   then   it goes away over a week  and they put it back on   apart from that  i i’ve worn sunscreen  but i’ve never put anything else on my face  nothing else my entire life  um  i’m arguably an alcoholic   i  i used to be a heavy smoker  i’ve been a cocaine addict    and my skin is fucking flawless    and you want to know why  because my skin learned at a very young age    that it couldn’t rely on me   my skin knew that i was not gonna help it  so it was like   all right  we’re going to have to produce our own oils if we’re gonna keep shit together   where women’s skin  women’s skin  every day  women’s skin is like this   i haven’t had my special cream    and that’s why you all age so horribly    yeah  i i don’t  i don’t do  as many misogynistic jokes as i used to  but i like to whip one in there every now and then   it’s funny because i didn’t  i used to do more back in the day  but what happened was  in our society  people started getting angry at me because they didn’t know i was joking  even though my job description would say    that i was possibly joking   so this is what happens now with comedians  for some reason  we’re enemy number one  every time we do a joke that you don’t like  you all go   why did you say that    why   i get asked at interviews   why would you say that joke   and you go   i thought it was going to be funny    it’s fucking ridiculous  i’m in trouble now for jokes that i did fucking ten years ago  people ring me up and go   you said this joke ten years ago   now  our job as comedians is  okay  if the line’s here  our job is to go right up to the line  that’s our fucking job  to take risks  to gamble  if you will  now  what happens when you gamble  you don’t always win   otherwise it wouldn’t be called fucking  gambling    so  what happens is we go all the way up to the line  right  which is fine  so  on my specials  i have jokes that have gotten through standards and practices and lawyers and everything  and still gotten on fucking netflix  and then you watch it years later  and you’re fucking angry  well  go fuck yourself  right  because   because  when i told the joke  the line was here  and it was socially acceptable  right  now you moved the line back to here  so i won’t go there anymore  i won’t  but the line’s here  but you can’t get angry because you moved the line and then the fucking joke was over here   and then  and then you have the audacity to ask me to maybe apologize for a fucking joke  here’s the thing  i wanted the joke to work  sometimes you tell a joke and it doesn’t fucking work  and then people go   why did you do that   you go   i tried to make the joke work  but it didn’t fucking work  and now you’re all upset with me    it’s like if a pilot smashes a plane into fucking the side of a mountain  you don’t go   why did you do that    he’ll go   my intention was to land the plane safely   but it turns out i failed at my job  but i didn’t  i didn’t wake up in the morning going   smash it     see  it’s like  i watched dave chappelle’s special  i watched his special  i thought it was fucking great   it was hilarious  and people got upset  and they got upset by different jokes in it  they get  see  here’s the thing  i didn’t enjoy every joke in his special  some of the things he said  i didn’t even agree with  but you know what happened  when i watched the jokes i didn’t enjoy  i got over it because i’m not a fucking pussy    all right  and i just listened to the ones i fucking enjoyed  see  he said that he thought that michael jackson didn’t fuck kids  eh   i think michael jackson did fuck kids   that’s how me and dave differ   a lot of people have stopped listening to michael jackson’s music  they go   i won’t listen to it anymore  i won’t listen to it anymore   i still listen to it   but i only listen to the jackson      cause if he was fucking kids back then  it was just experimenting  and there’s nothing wrong with that   i go all the way to  blame it on the boogie   and i fucking call it a day   so  look   what i’m trying to tell you is  she couldn’t pick which cream she wanted   and she’s looking at all the different creams  i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  box step   and i think to myself   fuck it  i’ve got to have a shit   now  there’s a bathroom in the back of the  uh  pharmacy  so i duck off  now  at this point of the story  i got to tell you  all right  that this girl’s a germophobe  it’s vital to the story that she’s a germophobe  now  we may have some people in the room who identify as germophobes and  to those people  go fuck yourself   i’ve  i’ve never met a person in my life who’s interesting who’s a fucking germophobe  you’re always boring cunts who tell us all the time that you’re a fucking germophobe  being a germophobe is doing a lot of heavy lifting for your shit fucking personality   how dare you act like we’re all diseased  every time we shake your hand  you go   i i can’t because  eh   every time you cook with a germophobe  you cook and put some scraps in the bin  you go   hey  can you take that out for the trash for me   and they’re like   i’d love to  but i can’t   because i’m a germophobe   and you’re like   the rest of us are loving it   you lick the bin   aah    you’re not special  while i’m at it  people with peanut allergies can fuck off an’ all   now  i’m not saying that there aren’t people with severe peanut allergies  there truly are  there’s people who will die if they eat a fucking peanut  what i’m saying is it’s your fucking problem   the rest of us don’t have to be involved  right  like  have you ever been on a plane lately  and they go like this  they go   uh  on today’s flight  we will not be serving peanuts  as there’s a person on the flight with a severe peanut allergy   and you’re like   all right  well  don’t give them to them  then    how fucking weak willed are these cunts   oh  i know it will kill me  but the salty goodness    like  what do they think the rest of us are going to fucking do  go to the air stewardess   uh  excuse me  uh  who has that peanut allergy     what do you think’s gonna happen if someone next to you eats a fucking peanut  do you think peanut particles will get in the fucking air  guess what  these flights fly back and forth and back and forth all fucking day  in between  they hardly clean the planes  do you think they’d go on with a special peanut  de peanut ing machine and fucking fill the fucking air   see  you know what i do  every time when i’m on a flight where they serve peanuts  what i do is i get six or seven peanuts  and i wedge them down the back of the fucking seat   and if someone ever dies  i’ll be the first person to say   i was wrong    now  i talked earlier about  like  how i did one misogynistic joke  and how  how  at the moment now  i i i don’t know if people know that i’m fucking joking  it’s become very odd now  this tension that we have about what’s right and what’s wrong  i was on a plane and this fucking  this woman was trying to put a bag in the overhead luggage  and she was shaking  and she can’t do it  and i went to help her  and she just looked at me and went   no  no   like that   and it’s  like  now i’m in trouble for trying to do a nice thing  that used to be my one move   i used to open doors  i used to lift bags  i used to stand up for pregnant people on buses  that was my fucking gig  that’s what i had going    and now  because i tried to help her  she’s  like  she’s  like  angry at me  like i’m trying to do a male patriarchy thing  where i can lift this better than you  so i just told her to fuck off   and  turns out  she’s just a woman with parkinson’s  and she did need my help   but that scenario could’ve been different is what i’m saying   like  i was in a movie  i was in a movie with my son  we were watching  a couple of years ago  we were watching the ghostbusters movie  the new one with the female cast  watching ghostbusters  my son  he’s four at the time  and he turns to me watching ghostbusters  and he goes   this movie’s not as good as the other ghostbusters   and i went   shut up  shh   you’re not allowed to say that  this movie’s every bit as good as the other ghostbusters  we’ll talk about it in the car    you know  and on reflection  that movie wasn’t as good   it was a shit fucking movie   wasn’t funny  the action sequences weren’t good  it was a fucking shit film  it wasn’t shit because women were in it  it was just shit because it was shit   you know what i mean  like  ’cause that cast  paul feig is the director  he directed bridesmaids  one of my top ten comedies  the rest of the cast was from that movie  they’d made good films together  this one was just a misfire  but the weird thing that happened was no one went to see that film  and then all of a sudden  men were pigs  men are fucking misogynistic assholes because that film didn’t do good  no  it didn’t do good because you women didn’t fucking see it either  if you went and saw the movie  if you went and saw the movie  it would have been a success  but you didn’t fucking see it  then you got angry at us for not fucking seeing it   do you want to know why it didn’t do well  it’s an action comedy  and if you go to any marketing company that talks about how they sell things  action comedies primarily are enjoyed by men  there might be exceptions to the rule  but primarily men like action comedies  do you want to know why  because we’re funny  and we do things  and   and  and women like dramas because you cause drama    so my point is  stop remaking our fucking movies  leave our movies alone  we don’t remake your films  you don’t see brad pitt and george clooney getting together to make mystic fucking pizza of the sisterhood of the ya ya fuckhead traveling pants movie   we leave your shit alone   although there should be some films that should be remade with  you know  different casts  like  one of my favorite movies from my childhood was  uh  nine to five  dolly parton  lily tomlin  jane fonda  fantastic  it still stands up today  it’s about three women  they have a boss who’s a fucking pig  like  it’s even poignant right now  they have a boss who’s a pig  so what they do is they drug him  and they put him in bondage gear  and they hang him from the roof of one of their garages for three weeks  it’s a fun film   you know  they should do that with a male cast  right  so  there’s a woman  you put her in the position of power   the three employees don’t like it  so they drug her  and they put her in bondage gear  and they hang her from the roof of one of their garages  it’s just a fun film   another movie that needs an opposite remake  brokeback mountain    that movie’s  it needs it   the original film is a couple of blokes  they’re working on the land  they ran out of conversation  so they went into a tent  and they fucked each other in the ass   my film  it’s a couple of young lasses  they’re working on the land  they’re doing a man’s job  they get bored  so they go into a tent  and they finger bang each other    my version doesn’t even need a tent   but one of the things that’s happening in cinema at the moment is  and i think we can all agree on this  okay  so  so we’re done with blackface people  stop doing that  people don’t like it  if if you’re getting ready for halloween and you think   i might do blackface   just don’t   it’s so much easier to not do blackface   like you don’t have to do anything  just save yourself time  see  the thing is  with actors now you’ve got in movies  i think we’ve all agreed that you can’t play outside your race  it goes back to  like  mickey rooney playing an asian character in breakfast at tiffany’s  don’t play outside your race  you can only play your race  i think we can all agree on that now  now  there’s another thing happening now  where the gays are getting upset if heterosexuals are playing gay people on film  i’m not sure about that  but i’m open to discussion  but here’s the thing that’s really fucking pissing me off  taron edgerton  or egerton  or whatever  he played elton john and eddie the eagle  two of the ugliest cunts that have ever lived   he’s really good looking  i don’t fucking like that   he’s playing uglyface  how many ugly actors would like that fucking opportunity   do the good looking people need fucking everything   like  charlize theron fucking gains    pounds  and all they say is   how brave    you know what’s brave  being ugly every single fucking day   so i decide to go off to the toilet  right  and i’m going off   and she goes   where are you going   and there’s no point lying anymore  so i just went like this   um  i have to shit myself    and she goes   if you take a shit in a public toilet  then i’ll never fuck you again   i was like     it’s a very good argument  that’s a  that’s what you call a quandary    so  i went   all right  but just fucking hurry up   so now i’m doing the  i have to shit myself  jog  i’m like   come on   pick a fucking cream  pick a cream  any cream  they’re all good  all of these creams are good   she’s not hurrying up  so i did what every man has done in a relationship  right  and there’s a few men in this room that probably did it this evening to get here on time  this is how you hurry up your wife or your girlfriend  every man does this  this is our special move  we go out  and we sit in the car   and we think   this’ll send a strong message    now  i assume women are like   ah  thank fuck he’s gone to sit in the car    so  i’m sitting in the car and i do this move  where i’ve leant like this  i leant all the way down  and i’m trying to breathe through it  like i’m in  like  a lamaze class  like    and the reason i’m sitting like this is because my theory is if i lay flat like this  the shit won’t come out as quickly  because of gravity  you see   if i sit upright  the shit has an easier way to fall   yeah  and also  sitting like this  i’m clenching my ass cheeks together   because if the shit gets past the sphincter  it won’t get past the impenetrable barrier that is me clenching my ass cheeks together  because i’m a fucking genius   and i’m sitting there  and i’m watching her through the window of the pharmacy   and she selects the cream  but then she stops a bit  right  then she goes back to get another cream  so i’ve got to hurry this up  so i start honking  just  honk  honk  she looks out like she’s really angry with me  then she’s going to the counter  i think   oh  good  she’s coming   then she just  like  bumps into a friend   starts fucking talking to someone  so  i thought   i’d better step this up a gear   so  i put the window down  and i lean my head out the window  and every time the sliding doors open like this    i went   i’m gonna shit myself   i’m gonna shit myself    now  i forget that i’m off the telly  i don’t think about it on a regular basis  right  so  i’m leaning out the window  yelling   i’m gonna shit myself   and this    year old kid skateboards by and goes   good luck with that  jim     so i’m sitting there yelling   i’m gonna shit myself   eventually she comes out  she gets in the car  and  like  obviously she’s upset  she has reason  i have been yelling   i’m going to shit myself   and honking the horn   she sits next to me and she goes   i cannot believe   and i went   no time to fight   this is not a drill    and i fucking fishtail out of the fucking car park  now i’m in ventura  and i’m whizzing through traffic  she’s holding on  fucking  the cream’s bouncing around  i see the golden arches  i see mcdonald’s  i turned to her  i said   could i please have a shit in the mcdonald’s   mcdonald’s are renowned for how clean they keep their toilets  i won’t even sit on the seat  i’ll just hover and spray    to that  i received a firm   no    so i have to make a decision  my house is five minutes away  her house is three minutes away  i i make a call  i’ve got to go to her house  it’s the only way i’ll make it  right  now  this  this kills me  every day i think about this  right  if i went to her house to begin with  i never would’ve had to stop to get the cream   so  anyway  we get into her house  we get in the driveway  she has a long driveway  i park the car  i get out  i’m already like this   come on    come on    she’s got the keys  so none of my running’s helping  she’s just fucking in heels  just going through her bag  i’m going   come on   now she’s stopped being angry  she just finds this hilarious   she’s just laughing  we get to the door  right  now  you know when you’ve really  you’ve  you really have needed to do a shit  it could be five minutes  it could be five hours  but there was an amount of time where you were desperate to do a shit  then you get to within    feet of the toilet   and your asshole starts to reward itself   for all the good work that you’ve put in   your asshole goes   yeah  we did it   we did it  we did it as a team  and that’s my favorite thing  that we did it together     cause you always get to the toilet  you always go   ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah   pooooooof   you never go  seat  poof  no  why is it that you always just made it  you’re not that lucky  there aren’t that many coincidences in the world    that you always just made it  it’s that your asshole has its own brain and a  like  pavlovian response  so anyway  i get up to the door  and i’m going   come on  come on  come on  come on  come on   and i’m  like  really yelling  she walks up  she gets the keys out  she’s laughing  she goes to put the keys in the door  she drops the keys      oh  the keys hit the ground  and i shit myself    and this isn’t just like a little warning squirt of  like   all right  there’s more where this came from   and it wasn’t like a full evacuation either  it wasn’t just like a full   pooof  like this  it was the weirdest thing  it was just shit coming out of me in a steady meter  just   no pushing   no pushing  everything from liquids to solids and everything in between   and i’d gone from being all  aaagh   to just a calmness    came over me  i was just   and my jeans are filling up   and instantly  the  the smell of human fecal matter has filled the air  and for the first time  she gets her ass into gear and she goes   oh  fuck   and she grabs the keys   and i went   oh  no  no  no  no  no   no point hurrying anymore   you take your time     all right  now  before i go  i’m gonna tell a very  very quick little story  um  my mother passed away a few months ago  and  um  when my mother died  look  my mother  uh was never  yeah  look  here’s the deal  my mother’s not a  wasn’t a funny woman  she had no  no sense of humor  never found me funny  she never watched anything that i did and went   that was funny   but she was always   she was always very supportive of me  and  you know  the only per  she was the only one in my life  the only one  that i bagged on my mother so much  i called her gunta  she was the butt of so many fucking jokes that i said  and i’ll give her this  she never complained  not fucking once  not once   so  i’d like to tell one story where she comes out of it a little bit cooler  right  now  when i was about    and my brother was about     we were home watching  uh  star wars  right  we were home watching star wars  i was on the throne of misery  my brother was on the couch  watching star wars  my brother scott  who’s a fucking nutjob  right  he turns to me and he goes   hey  jim  get me a coke   and i went   get your own fucking coke  i’m not gonna get you a coke   and he goes   get me a coke or i’ll piss on the carpet     what  what     get me a coke or i’ll piss on the carpet   i go   i’m not getting you a fucking coke   and he’s going   so you’d rather i just pissed on the carpet   i go   i guess that’s what i’m fucking telling you    and my brother walks to the middle of the living room  stands in front of me  gets out his cock  starts pissing on the carpet  and he looks at me and he goes   i don’t know why you constantly find the need to cause trouble   it would have been so easy for you just to get a coke  but  no  not jim  has to be difficult   then he shakes his cock  puts it away  goes back  lies down  now  this is the bit that fucking kills me   he doesn’t get a coke   so  i was sitting there  you know     degrees celsius  no air conditioning  fucking  a puddle of urine in the middle of the living room  just steaming upwards  now we’re onto about  we’re probably on return of the jedi by now  my mom comes in  and she does that thing that parents do when they have no words  she walks in  just to see the urine in the middle  and she went like this   why   who  who would  who would  why    and then she went   every fucking day it’s something different  every day    and then she went   who did this   and i didn’t want to get in trouble  so i went   scott did it   and she turned to scott and she goes   what did you do that for   and he went   i told jim to get me a coke  or i’d piss on the carpet    and my mother turns to me and goes     why didn’t you get him a coke  you know he’s fucking mental    ladies and gentlemen  thank you very
